# Fake-Review-Monitoring-System
Designed and developed a system using machinelearning algorithms to detect potentially fake reviews. Utilized natural language processing techniques for language analysis,
sentiment analysis, and user behavior patterns.

With the continuous evolve of E-commerce systems, online reviews are mainly considered as a crucial factor for building and maintaining a good reputation. Moreover, they have
an effective role in the decision-making process for end users. To solve the concept of fake reviews, we wanted to build a project that can help to predict accurate or near 
to accurate results for reviews to be fake or original based on certain parameters. To implement this we analysed, pre-processed the data. We categorised reviews using many 
conditions and applied various machine learning classifiers to get the accuracy of prediction. Further, we applied another technique involving results of all classifiers to get the best
possible and suitable result.
