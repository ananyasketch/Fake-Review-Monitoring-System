New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,A Very Good Flashlight & Lightweight Charger,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery.

Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.

There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.

That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!",8/28/2015,1440749723,193.120.185.213

From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars.",8/28/2015,1440735712,205.55.97.209

Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\""Turn It On\\"".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",8/27/2015,1440615789,200.17.229.32

I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.

It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.

Gym perfection.,"Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.",8/27/2015,1440659906,219.70.227.131

It is made with high quality materials. I love the fact the the radio is light weight and has a great grip. It is not heavy like Motorols that i used in past. My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio. Below are few pictures of the radio that i took when i first received them.",8/24/2015,1440380759,199.138.3.69

They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone. VERY COOL!",8/24/2015,1440394297,216.180.204.56

E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features,"I ordered this E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features. On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving.",8/22/2015,1440187283,195.232.1.30

The sound quality is horrible.,"I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.

I tried to use it as a fixed station, but there were spurious blips and sputter that were traced to strong signals 16 Mhz away..  It was always breaking squelch and noisy. The microphone audio on transmit was horrible.  I went to return the radio, but found I had missed the deadline by 5 days, so now I have a $99 item for the trash barrel.",8/22/2015,1440231992,193.79.146.212

Fortunately I opened this one up to load some stuff for him and try it out a bit, but I'm not even sure I'm going to give it to him.  I'm 100% sure he will use it once and never pick it up again.

And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

I have the original lighting cable that came with my 6 in my work truck and it takes a beating, from being bent up sitting in the cup holder when I use my GPS and when I unplug it letting it hit the floor and drag all over the dirt, it still works perfectly. On the other hand, these iXCC cables by my night stand, only charging my phone for short periods before I go to bed, lasts on average about a month and a half or two months. Weird considering it doesn't get beat up or dragged around and isn't being constantly used like the other one.

If you are not inclined with wirings and stuff in the car it will be hard for you to install this. We installed it to where when you put the car in reverse, the monitor will turn on and this will give the view. My husband really likes this! It gives a good view at the back and keeps everyone safe when backing up. It works well at night too. If only I knew that putting a rear camera isn't that costly I would have done it long time ago.

Overall having bluetooth capability in my vehicle  it has enhanced my driving experience.",8/18/2015,1439902488,214.214.238.152

I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review but would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera to serve it's purpose.",8/18/2015,1439902627,211.163.79.169

DON'T BUY,"This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(",8/17/2015,1439833521,207.69.205.41

I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys.",8/17/2015,1439783636,220.125.228.143

And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector.",8/17/2015,,

While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

The mounting systems on these players are one of the largest differences between them & lesser players; they are solid-cast metal harnesses with mobile, &#34;floating&#34; T-locks that do both a great job of supporting the player, allowing versatility and security in mounting the units to the headrest support poles.  Most other competitors for half the price have nylon band that you have to cinch down around the unit and headrest support poles that are a pain and tend to slouch over time.  Minimal cords (largely due to a single power cord & IR headphones not requiring any plug-ins) give it a clean appearance in a nice luxury sedan and increases the ease of my children getting out of the back seat exponentially.  Probably the most important aspect of this player is picture quality, which is outstanding; and I would relate to that of a Retina display on an iPad- very vivid and seems that they almost solved the sun glare problem.  They also do not show any signs of aging from being constantly installed in the car during the hot months of summer, only time will tell for the winter.  Finally, the biggest difference to us and a major reason for purchasing these units at a higher price, was the steady-state drive.  Those who are not familiar with this aspect may completely overlook this most-important characteristic that differentiates this player from other products; since this will be our third pair of rear entertainment players in five years, I can attest to the importance of this in terms of durability for those looking for this product to entertain young children.  The past two set of players (not solid-state) had front 'doors' that opened with a latch which always 'happened' to get broke off from certain someones trying to change a disc by themselves, while their loving parents were trying to keep the vehiclebetween the lines; and read the disc with a floating eye-reader, rather than a fixed eye from a uniform read point constantly.  Just for the durability factor, I will always opt for solid-state drive rather than door and floating eye reader; the solid-state players 'feed' the discs into a slot on the side or bottom.  Only time will tell to the durability of this, but my hypothesis should prove to be sound.  The only slight minus to a solid-state is that it seems to be much more finicky with reading scratched or smudged discs than floating-eyed readers; but then we just need to keep the DVDs in better shape, folks!",8/15/2015,,

I recommend this graphic card with anyone with a GT 560 or less.",8/15/2015,,

I am an avid music listener and tend to buy the higher quality products because I do not like distorted sound when I listen to my music.  This speaker is very high quality and came charged and ready to play straight out of the box.  I have to say I was very impressed when it arrived.  The design is very nice it has touch buttons to control from the top of the speaker or you can use your device's buttons.  Either way it goes I think you will be very impressed with the quality of sound that travels out of this product.  You can hear all of your 1's and 2's clearly without any static cracking or interference.  The battery life on it is quite good as well I had no problems with it playing for over 3 hours.  It is not cheaply made.  I am thrilled to have gotten this device at a lower cost in return for my unbiased opinion of the product.  I really love this product and the delivery of the treble, base, and midtones.  I would highly recommend anyone to try this product.

I have a car camera in every vehicle our family owns and each camera is different based on what was available at the time.  I have only had one wreck.  It was at a four way stop and I stopped and was turning left.  The vehicle coming the opposite way was approaching his stop sign as I was going through.  He ran through his stop and hit my rear quarter panel.  Know what he said when the cop arrived.  He said I ran the stop sign.  You should have seen the look on the guys face when I told the officer that I had a car camera.  Case closed.<br /><br />Anyway.  I have learned to buy simple inexpensive car cameras.  I dont need GPS or G sensors.  I do not like G sensors because any vibration in the car or camera mount can alert the G sensor and it will lock the file.  If that happens enough then your sd car fills up with locked files that will not be overwritten like normal files.  That can stop all recording until you erase the locked files.  The description says the camera has a G sensor but it does not. Also, the LEDs for night driving are not automatic and there are only two LEDs. They have to be turned on manually.  Now if you have had cameras with the LEDs for night driving then you know they are pretty worthless because they do not shine enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front of the camera which is not helpfull for video at night.  Your headlights provide the illumination.  In my experience most of these cameras are ok at night but you will not be able to read words or license plates.<br /><br />The setup is easy on the camera and the instructions understandable.  I recorded a clip at 720x480 which is one less than the highest resolution the camera offers.  You judge for yourself.<br /><br />I do not know how long the camera will last but I will update if it stops working.  Also dont turn motion sensitivity on unless you need it.  With it off the camera operates like a normal car cam.  It turns on and starts recording when you start the car and then turns off a few seconds after you turn the ignition off.",08-12-2015,1439374441,219.60.237.179

One IMPORTANT thing to know that will save you tons of headache: If the panel you are installing this tweeter on is too thin, the mounting screws will bottom out on the solder connections of the voice coil to the terminals and cause catastrophic failure! I'm ashamed to say, but I couldn't figure it at first and assumed I had defective tweeters. When I realize what was happening it was very obvious. The supplied mounting screws are long enough to short to the terminals and/or force their way into the solder connections enough to destroy the contact. I ruined 3 tweeters before I figured out what was happening, but fortunately I was able to salvage them by re-soldering the connections. These would be awesome tweeters if the documentation was better and warned you of this pitfall. I wasted a TON of time because of this issue, and not happy.

When I first got it I used the SD card included (and later a SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card). Updated firmware from website then installed it in the front as Blackvue suggested. Used the iphone to change features within the camera, which was a little of a hassle due to the password -claimed it was such and such in the papers that came with it, and it wasn't. I had to go online and find others that had the same issue and used the password they got in with. Took about an hour to finally get in. Not a big issue once I got in.<br /><br />Checked video, it was terrible. Figured it was the card and firmware update. Checked online and I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br />Contacted Blackuve and they said &#34;because you purchased from Amazon and you live in the US, we cannot and will not help you&#34; - cut short and dry; they said it ruder / more unprofessional.<br /><br />So I dealt with it, and waited for another firmware update thinking it would help. Updated SD card to the SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card) helped some, but not by too much.<br /><br />Moved the camera done some from the rear view mirror (closer to the dashboard) and it helped a little more. So at this time, it was in the middle of my windshield, but still in the middle. Video was okay, still couldn't see license plates and that is huge with me. (a lot of hit and runs here).<br /><br />Since purchase, it would stop working, out of the blue. I would always leave it plugged in (I *did not* use parking mode; and with my cars, the power cuts off after 10 minutes auto) and from time to time, after starting the car, the recording would not even start until the GPS would kick in, which meant it would not start for almost half my journey. At times, the GPS would kick in, and the record would never start. There were times it didn't record at all, but the recording light would flash. I would get home and there would be nothing recorded. I would check on the phone and I would see live view, but it was not filling up. That happened more than 7 times.<br /><br />It would restart itself randomly. Very annoying, especially when you thought it was recording. I would be in the car over an hour and it would just say &#34;Blackvue for your driving safety&#34; for the first time, after an hour of driving, so I missed all that time. :|<br /><br />It died February 19th, 2014. I had my son look at it and we worked on it together and got it back up and running. And yes, all that happened within 2 months.<br /><br />Again died 2 weeks later. Fixed.<br /><br />Got sick of it and purchased 2 GoPro's used the Blackvue in the back, which strangely, the video was great. I could actually see front license plates, but where I live, SC, front license plates aren't expected; so I only saw tourists or vanity plates.<br /><br />Blackvue died again a month and half later. Had my son look at it because I was sick of it. He said he didn't want to mess with it again, but I talked him into it because I needed it for speed/mph reporting. He said it was due to power. The cord wasn't connecting.<br /><br />Got it working again. Left it plugged in so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and only unplugged it if there were an emergency, which meant if I had to update the firmware, format the card (which you could do in the camera, but mine would not do that), change cards or get info, I couldn't do that.<br /><br />Two months after that, not even a full two months, the SD card function, that holds the card in and let it come out, the spring, broke, so I could not get the card to go in, and I almost couldn't get the damn thing to come out, I had to force it out. Asked my son once again to fix it.. he took a look and said it was not fixable because the way they had it put together inside. I told him he could keep it. He said he didn't want it - and this is a guy who will take anything for his electronics and he didn't want that. So I tossed it. I spent over $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any. I purchased it here and I'm in the US. That's a loop hole apparently because according to Miss Rudy Huxtable (that's a pun, she was rude as a donkey) I wasn't supposed to, or allowed to have it!<br />- Had to constantly check on firmware for it and install it to make sure the video was at least useable - still wasn't. When I'd update the firmware, it was a hit and miss because when you update, you have to delete the previous installment off the card by either formatting it again or just deleting it.<br />- the power cord is long enough for the back (standard vehicle) to the front *but* if you unplug it a lot, like once a week, it will wear out and not power up anymore, like mine did more than a few times.<br />- it lets you know the SD card isn't there even though, uh, it is.<br />- says it's recording, but it's not.<br />- says audio is starting even if you have it turned off via app or camera and aren't even touching it... even wondered if I had a ghost a few times in the car with me ...or bugs.<br />- wi-fi does the same; off.. on, off, on.. doesn't connect.<br />- gets hot even if it's not recording.<br />- video did better in the back BUT I had to get out to fix the plug unexpectedly a lot because of the power issue so it would go in and out of power and I'd be lucky when it would restart, if it would start recording because of THAT issue as well.<br />- other issues, but like I said, it's been over a year and my memory isn't great with this product because I HATED it.<br /><br />For that price, I would rather have a small person or a fairy sit in the back and take notes and hold a recorder. . . . that's why I turned around and got GoPro's.. (psssst. the $129 is *much* better than the more expensive ones.. I got the expensive one first and the cheaper later and it does *much* better than that!) I have the cheaper one in back and it picks up everything .. the expensive one in front.. I just need a dash cam to pick up speed/mph, GoPro's don't do that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like Blackvue, because it's wi-fi, speed and GPS but honestly, it's a piece of junk - at least here [on 'A'] it is.r $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any.

US,52486291,R3ORXLHEDCGNYU,B00Y2100OO,161663398,LiteXim All in One Large Touch Screen Hands Free Digital Mp3/Mp4 Music Player Music/Audio/FM radio & Micro SD Card (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,7,8,N,N,Excellent Price for Very Good Product,"There are only a couple of things I didnt like about this MP3 player. The instructions included with this MP3 player don't apply to this model. Plus, you have to buy an SD chip for the memory. The FLASH DRIVE is just large enough to hold the system memory. You cant store music files on this, unless you buy a SD chip. (They cost $6 for a 16 gig chip.) With that out of the way,  I'm very impressed this player. For starters, they fixed the one big problem, that the older cheap MP3 players had. On older models, you could not access the folders that held your songs. If you had a 8 gig chip, the only way to browse through the music, was song by song. Now they have files set up, so you can scan by band. Once you click on the band file, you can chose the album. Once you chose the album file, you can chose the song. With literally hundreds of albums able to be stored on a 16 gig chip, that makes this a very functional MP3 player. As for the sound, I'm really happy with the quality. The digital decoder, and amplifier is of sufficient quality, to let you listen to music without distortion. Of course, the weak link of the chain would be the headphones. (Don't even bother using the earphones that come with this. Buy good quality headphones or earphones, and use those.) Another issue with these cheap MP3 players, concerns the battery life. Of course its rechargeable, but there's a trick to recharging some Li-ion batteries. (READ BOTTOM OF REVIEW.)<br /><br />So you get a nice MP3 player, that can clip onto your pants or shirt, when you're out and about. It has FM radio (the headphone wire is the antennae, so don't expect to use a Bluetooth transmitter with this, and listen to the radio.) You can record with this too. (again, if you buy a chip.) I suppose you could download a video on this (like a Utoob clip, or gif file), but I don't think it would be worth the effort. Why watch it on a one inch screen? Also, you could download a book, but the screen maybe would show 5-7 words at a time. It would take forever just to read a page. Right now, this player is available for less than a ten dollar bill, which really surprises me. An affordable MP3 player? Excellent. Actually, trading out the SD chips, is a cool option. If you have a lot of music, you can create various SD chips with MP3 files, for your jazz music, alternative, EDM, or folk and classical. By the way, the MP3 player does read WMP files, in case you rip in that format. (As I do.)<br />UPDATE: (September 29th 2015)<br />I've been using this MP3 player at the gym, four days a week, for a couple of months now. It always recharges well, plus it keeps a charge for at least a few hours. I have not had a single problem with this MP3 player. The battery is EXCELLENT on this model. Listen, I've been burnt with inexpensive MP3 players, so I was very cautious reviewing the LiteXim product. I expected it not to perform, and I was wrong to doubt the quality of this product. Considering how inexpensive it is, I have to admit, its one of the best bargains, that I have had the pleasure to review. So I raised the review from four stars to five.  If you want an MP3 player, and don't mind supplying your own SD chip (which are so inexpensive now), this is a good choice.<br /><br />If you do run into a problem with the player, it will be with the battery not wanting to take a recharge. Here's the fix.<br /><br />RECHARGING a LITHIUM ION BATTERY, that wont recharge.<br />Sometimes, the battery will wear out.  You can try to recharge them, but nothing happens. The trick is to remove ALL remaining charge from the battery, before you recharge. To do this, you need to turn the MP3 player ON. You'll get a WELCOME screen, a &#34;LOW BATTERY LEVEL&#34; screen, then a &#34;BYE BYE&#34; screen. Then turn it off. Then turn it on, repeating the process, until the player only FLASHES the welcome screen for a second. Keep going, turning it on, after it turns off, until it WILL NOT TURN ON AT ALL. When its completelydead, plug it into the charger. Now, be patient. It takes DAYS to recharge. I have found, that if you keep the MP3 player turned ON during charging, that it will charge better. (Maybe let it charge in OFF mode, for a couple of days. Then, let it charge in ON mode. ) Be patient. Eventually, in 2-3 days, the battery will recharge. The charge will be good for 4-5 hours, maybe less.<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS<br />You have four buttons. POWER is also the PLAY button. You have the - / + buttons on top, on either side of the &#34;M&#34; button. You need to go into the &#34;M&#34; screen, to access everything like VOLUME, REPEAT, etc. Use the - / + buttons to navigate. The &#34;M&#34; button selects. Volume is hard to control on this MP3 player. You need to find that MODE screen, then select VOLUME, then select the volume with navigator buttons. However, once you discover this for yourself, its fairly easy. I deducted a star, because of no instructions (at least no instructions that apply to this model), and because it doesn't come with any usable memory. Actually, I'd like to say FOUR AND A HALF STARS. ITs a nice MP3 player, even if you do have to supply your own SD Chip. So for the price, how much can you complain?<br />I was provided a free MP3 player in exchange for a fair and honest review.tient. It takes DAYS to recharge.

I've made the mistake of not pressing the volume buttons long enough, and it's annoying to have to skip or restart the song. But those are just nit-picky.

You really have to look at the speaker in person, to appreciate its futuristic look. That is mostly thanks to the honeycomb design on top of the speaker grill at the front of the speaker. On top of that, the polygonal-shaped buttons located at the top of the speaker add to the futuristic look. Overall, the design of the speaker is on-point, and nothing like anything seen on other Bluetooth speakers on the market. It doesn't end there - the build quality of the speaker is as solid as it looks. Its matte plastic (soft-touch plastic) construction all around allows the speaker to not draw fingerprints and scratches, and allows the speaker to feel very well-built and sturdy. I don't see this speaker falling apart anytime soon.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - 10/10<br />With this speaker, I was able to get around 8 hours of music playback time, which falls short of the promised 10 hours of music playback time. However, don't get me wrong here - 8 hours of music playback time is PHENOMENAL compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range. 8 hours. Of straight music-playing. Trust me, you won't have any complaints with the battery life of this speaker.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 9.5/10<br />At first when I got this speaker, the sound quality was almost mediocre - the overall sound was muffled, and it was horrible. But then when I used this speaker for about 2 hours or so, and let the speakers \\""burn-in\\"", the sound got much clearer. It got clearer to the point where its sound quality is one of the best in its class - well-balanced mids, highs, and lows, as well as just enough bass for my taste. The bass IS a bit overpowering, but I personally like that sort of sound. Vocals and instrumentals are quite clear, nothing crazy, but for a Bluetooth speaker of this price range, it's fantastic.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - 10/10<br />Just like any other Bluetooth speaker and any other device in today's market, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB. The standard stuff, and it works fine, so no complaints there. There's also an AUX port, in case your device's Bluetooth doesn't work, or your device simply doesn't have Bluetooth. Finally, the speaker also comes with a TF (Micro SD Card) slot, allowing you to play music on the speaker WITHOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE! This is quite fantastic in my opinion, as you can just carry around this speaker (with a Micro SD Card, of course), jamming to your favorite tune. Overall, the functionality of this speaker is great.<br /><br />VERDICT/OVERALL EXPERIENCE - 10/10<br />Overall, I really can't find much to complain about this speaker. From its build quality, battery life, sound quality, and functionality, the speaker excels in every single aspect. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a mid-range Bluetooth speaker that sounds better than a low-range speaker, or even your phone's speaker.arket, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB.

Everything checks out.,"[[VIDEOID:14b148326c3fb038894a1c2bb2ffdab6]] .<br />It has enough juice to start a medium-large car engine, no problem. (It started my 4.0 Liter V6.)<br /><br />I also use it inside my camper van as a 12-volt power supply for lighting and a fan. Works well (see below).<br /><br />There are over a dozen brands on amazon that are nearly identical to this model, so you can shop around. Those that look identical to this model may have minor differences in the carrying case, connectors provided, emergency light features, etc. The 4 \\""clones\\"" I tested all seem to have come from the same factory because they have so many details in common.<br /><br />This model comes with a 4-way USB cable (Micro-, Mini-, Apple 30-pin, and Apple Lightning.) Very nice. Probably better than the ones that come with different USB tips for you to lose.  And the cable can charge more than one device at a time.The Lightning connector works fine...no errors or complaints with my iPhone 6.<br /><br />ZoZo has a similar model ([[ASIN:B012FNABVC ZoZo TM15]]) that I also tested. I like this one better.<br /><br />Li-Ion batteries don't like heat. I would definitely not keep this in my trunk. And even keeping it in your car could ruin the battery over time if you do a lot of outside parking in warm weather.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br /> - Works as described<br /> - It looks and feels like good quality<br /> - Nice quality 120-volt AC and 12-volt DC charging adapters<br /> - Nicely designed case<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br /> - Mine came with no user guide. Not sure why.<br /><br /> - - - Capacity - - -<br /><br />The stated mAh (milli-Amp hours) for all these battery packs is NOT the amount of amp-hours delivered at 12 volts (or 5, 16, 19 volts). It's the amp-hours delivered at 3.7 volts by the internal Li-ion cells before the conversion to higher voltage output. This unit's 16.8-amp hour spec means you would get a maximum of 5.18 amp-hours at 12-volts, for example. It's 62 watt-hours of power, no matter which voltage output you're using.<br /><br />- - - Connector Sizes - - -<br /><br />It comes with lots of connector tips for 12-16-19 volt output, but it's nice the know the main unit uses very common connector sizes, in case you want to attach your own cables. The 12-16-19 volt output is a 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel connection. The input (for recharging) is 3.5mm/1.35mm.<br /><br />  - - - Nighttime Power in an RV - - -<br /><br />It's working well for me to power two bright LED lamp fixtures a tiny exhaust fan in my small RV.<br /><br />One minor hassle is, the unit shuts itself off after about 1 minute if it's not being used. There is no auto-start. You have to hit the battery power button whenever you want to turn your devices on. You can't just turn your lights off and on without restarting the battery pack. The competing models I looked at also work this way.<br /><br />Also, you could accidentally bump the voltage to 16 or 19 volts if you hit the power button an extra time (or at the wrong time), possibly frying your 12-volt devices.<br /><br />- - - Disclosure - - -<br /><br />The manufacturer gave me this item for review.

It also was difficult to press the on/off button through the rubber.  Overall, it's just awkward and not worth even the low cost.",08-07-2015,1438955657,219.67.101.14

However, the vendor is super-fast and DHL managed to get it from the warehouse in China on a Friday morning to my doorstep in Florida by Monday afternoon - very good first impression, and major props to DHL as the shipper!<br /><br />Installation in my wife's 2014 Jetta SE was easy, and the longest part of the job was tucking the USB cable for the (optional) front DVR camera into the headliner. I would recommend using one of the trim tool kit's from Amazon, such as this one http://www.amazon.com/KINGLAKE®-Panel-Removal-Radio-Installer/dp/B00HNMLQAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1438978963&sr=8-3&keywords=car+stereo+trim+tool which helps getting the USB cable under the headliner without any drama.<br /><br />The Joying web site said only SD/TF cards up to 32Gb, but I filled a 128Gb card with MP3, AAC, and FLAC songs and plugged it into the SD slot and then powered the head-unit on. The first start-up took about 45 seconds, and I was a little worried that it would take that long each time I started the car, but subsequent starts were around 20 seconds. Would be nice if it was a bit faster, but not too bad a delay.<br /><br />A little later I found a configuration setting that let's you set a sleep delay from 5 minutes, up to a few hours. What this does is put the head-unit in a sleep mode, but keeps it powered on for a quick restart of around 5 seconds. I set it to 15 minutes, and it's super nice when you are stopping and starting your car multiple times during the day - get back in and turn the ignition on within the 15 minute timer and the music is pumping within seconds. Since these head-units use a decent amount of power, I don't think I'd leave it in this mode for more that 15 or 30 minutes as it will cause some additional drain on your battery in this mode.<br /><br />So how did I like the operation of the head-unit?  The GPS software is nice, and after 15 years with stand-alone Garmin units, the IGO software is a nice change. The radio app supports RDS, and has 18 presets you can set manually, or press the magnifying glass icon to have it automatically set the first 18 stations it finds. Reception seems good, and it gets the same stations the VW RCD310 radio was picking up in my driveway.<br /><br />The Video app found a couple of MP4 video files on the SD card, and plays them as you would expect. I found the movies to be a little dark but that was mid-day in the Florida sun. Checking again in the evening, and they looked great.<br /><br />The Music app works, but could do with some improvements. It takes about 30 seconds to scan all the songs on my 128Gb SD card before it starts playing them. Unfortunately it rescans the SD card every time you turn the car on, so that was a pain. Took a few minutes to login to my Google account, and through Google Play was able to download the PowerAmp music player. Problem solved!  It saves the last song played and starts with that song the next time the car is started. Double bonus is that it can be configured to NOT rescan the SD and USB storage devices, so it's ready to go within a few seconds.<br /><br />I plugged an older iPod Classic into one of the USB cables Joying provide, but nothing happened. With the Pioneer unit in my car the music player detects the iPod and presents the contents of the iPod in the same format as SD files. With the Joying I couldn't get the iPod to work at all, so I emailed their support staff to get their help. First thing the next morning I had an email telling me the iPod needed a special cable that could be ordered from their web site, so I ordered one. When it arrived I saw that it had a 16-pin block connector on one end that needed to be plugged in to the motherboard inside the head-unit. Ten minutes to remove the head0unit from the dashboard, 5 minutes to find a small screwdriver, 2 minutes to open the case, 1 minute to plug the new cable it, 2 minutes to close up the case, and 5 minutes to put it all back into the dash - a bit annoying as I would have ordered the 'special cable' at the same time as head-unit if I had known that it was required.<br /><br />After enabling the iPod support in the configuration settings, and starting the iPod application it still did not work. The Joying head-unit displayed the name of my iPod but never displayed any of the songs or playlists on it. I should mention this is a modified iPod Classic and has 128Gb of flash memory. Plugging in a newer iPod Touch worked fine, so it probably does not like the older operating system on the Classic.<br /><br />The Car Recorder application is cool, and records video from the front-facing camera I installed. The camera itself is a basic unit, and the Car Recorder app also worked with a Logitech C920 camera I tested it with. It saves the video in compressed format onto the SD card in the GPS slot, and this is not configurable so I replaced the Joying supplied 8Gb card with a 64Gb Class-10 Samsung card. With 4 gigs for the GPS software there is lots of space for recording your trips, or just day to day driving. Using the File Explorer application I could see that there were multiple MP4 files and LOG files with the same name. The  LOG files contain the GPS coordinates and date & time information, and looking at the video's for playback in the Car Recorder app overlays that metadata onto the MP4 video being shown, but it will not be present if you just copy the MP4 file of the GPS card and give it to someone in the event of a proble - always give them the LOG file that matches the MP4 file.<br /><br />My one real annoyance is the Bluetooth app while streaming music from my phone - music comes through fine, and the forward and back controls do what you expect but there is no song title or artist information. Looks like they have a little work to do getting that displayed.<br /><br />I don't have any 3G / 4G  USB devices to test internet access with, but it connects to my home WiFi while in the driveway, and it also connects to my iPhone running as a personal hotspot if you want Spotify, Wave or other services that require internet access. Looking at the User Guide I see the head-unit can function as a wireless hotspot itself, so I'm assuming that only works with a 3G or 4G-USB device.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice unit with a couple of minor irritants. Since I bought it there has been an upgrade that I applied, and it looks like the Joying folks will continue to release updated code for these head-units. Very happy with this purchase!",08-07-2015,1438890040,201.179.243.199

The bottom portion of the speaker has a slight angle to it, giving you more control over sound direction than most speakers in this market segment. Between the top and bottom areas of the speaker is a thin light band that glows (or blinks) blue or red depending on the speaker's connection or pairing status. While the design looks great and is very stylish, it's bright enough that it would probably be distracting if you wanted to listen to this speaker in a dark room.<br /><br />The individual raised buttons look good. While their wood grain pattern is slightly different than the rest of the speaker, it blends nicely and subtly sets the buttons apart. They all have raised symbols on them denoting their functions. My only gripe with them is that the Volume Up button is on the left and the Volume Down button is on the right, which is opposite of most speakers I've used or seen.<br /><br />The speaker volume has a nice range. I listened to a variety of music with it, though my favorite testing track is Sam Robson's \\""I Need Thee Every Hour\\"" from his YouTube channel (look him up!). It sounded beautiful through the speaker, and the volume was able to get plenty loud. The on-device volume setting is independent of your phone/tablet/etc's bluetooth volume setting, so make sure you haven't turned one of the two down by accident if you find the speaker won't get loud. While I couldn't find information on what version of Bluetooth this speaker uses, I suspect it's Bluetooth 4.0 as I didn't notice any discernible lag between the video on my Galaxy Note 4 and the audio coming out of the speaker.<br /><br />I really like how the speaker uses different status tones for things like Power On, Bluetooth Paired, and Max Volume. A lot of other speakers use spoken words instead of tones, and usually they just come out sounding like very poorly pronounced or broken English, and it gives the speaker a cheap feel. My only gripe with the status tones is the Power On tone ... it is ALWAYS loud no matter where you have the volume set when you turned the speaker off, and it often startles me. Overall, though, it's not a deal-breaker by any means.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this speakers sound, looks, and especially its slightly tilted design and status-light ring; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a portable single-driver Bluetooth speaker based off its performance. It's aesthetics are just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Review disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for the purposes of examination and review.

I would recommend spending those few extra $s and buying an iPod Nano from Apple. That being said, my three-star review is directed firmly at Apple and the 7th gen Nano itself...<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly (as Jony Ive would no doubt tell you) a wonderful, magical device and a miracle of modern engineering. The 7th gen's internal amp is a slight step up from that of the 6th gen Nano with a cleaner sound and marginally quieter noise floor, although I still prefer the size (and clip) of the 6th gen model. Here's why the 7th gen Nano only gets three stars from me. For a dedicated DAP that does basically nothing but play music and has no internet-connection capabilities of any kind, 16 Gb storage is pathetic and paltry. (Technically, it can play video too, but with the tiny screen and tiny amount of storage, I'm not sure why Apple even bothered with this capability.) After waiting three years for a refresh of this product, what do we get? Improved internals? More storage? At least the OPTION to pay lots of extra $$$$s for more storage? Nope. We get new colors. That's right -the opportunity to buy the exact same thing, but in a slightly different color.  Come on Apple. Get your act together.",08-04-2015,1438632746,200.88.190.101

I may be spoilt from simple mono banders and the simple & basic programming the Baofengs with CHIRP, but programming the VR-6600Pro manually is a chore.<br /><br />But once you have it programmed it is easy to use and a powerful rig.  I would just not recommend it to a novice user who is just starting out in radio.  Once I had the radio programmed it was a piece of cake for my daughter to operate the radio, but difficult for me to remember the steps to make changes.  I would find myself having to scroll through bands via the [B] key a lot if wanted to toggle from VHF to UHF and back to VHF, because there is no backwards with the [B]. One Press to go from VHF to 220Mhz, another press to skip the 300Mhz band , then 6 more presses to go back to VHF, as you have toggle through the extra bands.  Even when you disable the wide RX coverage, you still have Line In, AM and FM bands to toggle through.  I have sent a feature request into VGC to see about getting Line In, AM and FM moved into the expanded section.  I would like to just have 144, 220 & 440 on my mobile rig!<br /><br />While not a lab grade test, Amelia and I were able to have a QSO in simplex VHF from our house to a ham in Tracy 39 miles away as the crow flies with 50 watts.  All our on air reports have been favorable, nothing out of the ordinary either pro or con.  So no objections to on air performance at all.<br /><br /> My theories on the overall feature set and radio operation are the following:<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is a land mobile radio company where features, adjustability and flexibility are king.  The radios will be programmed by a technician, who has time to study and configure the radio for a semi static operation.  The average business will not reprogram frequencies often and will mostly just use the memory function.  This leads to a lot of advance features, but less focus on simpler operations, programing ease and the User Interface/Experience.<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is innovating with the APRS features, but again, it is deep in the feature set and not a novice grade set up.<br /><br />* When I sent in a feature request that would make manual programming easier for hams, the factory politely vetoed my suggestion to retain maximum flexibility.  I think this is due to the land mobile vision.<br /><br />APRS Setup<br /><br />I have the APRS module ready to set up, I downloaded APRSdroid for my Android phone, I sent off and got a passcode, but have not had time to set up APRS on the radio. I will get the APRS function set up as soon as I mount the radio.<br /><br /> Quick Reference<br /><br />There are a couple short cuts and quick references I will be setting up for the radio.  Little things that can make a hams life easier.  Keep an eye out on the VR6600 Facebook page.",08-04-2015,1438677908,210.105.65.65

You will need the reviews on Amazon because documentation is somewhere between minimal and nonexistent.<br />A couple of comments:<br />There are buttons that I have no idea what they do. One I accidentally pushed caused a lock icon to appear briefly, so I have to assume that it locks that file for later viewing. I have no idea which button that is nor was I able to replicate the behavior.<br />When you’re changing the language note that you cannot get into the menu if the device is plugged in. The menu only appears when powered by battery. You hit “menu” twice because the first push takes you to settings and the second push moves you to the menu tab with language options. Other reviews diagram what to look for in the default Russian for changing the language.<br />If you use a zip-tie to connect it to your rear view mirror you then don't have to worry about it coming disconnected on hot days. Carefully place so that it does not prevent you putting your mirror in night mode.<br />If the device keeps shutting itself off it likely has one of two problems:<br />If the light is red, it's losing power and the battery is not sufficient to run it without available power. Check your power cord and reseat it until the red light goes out and turns pink or blue (pink = charging, blue=charged).<br />If the light is not red but it repeatedly shuts off, take out the MicroSD card and format it on your computer. Although it overwrites old data, deleted files may still be enough to make the device think there is no storage available. Once you format it’ll work again.<br />As noted in other reviews, a class-4 MicroSD of no more than 16 GB is required. You can use a larger card, but it will not overwrite.<br />The camera is not locked into position, it moves around a bit, but if your cord is not pulling on it, it will generally hang flat.<br />The cord is extra long so that you can run it under the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet. Note that it is not long enough if your power is not on the dash. Mine is in the hatch under my elbow and it's about 12 inches too short to go along the front window, down the A pillar, under the dash, and then back to the hatch where my power ports reside.<br />Generally a decent starter camera. If it dies I will probably buy a more expensive one with support and documentation, but so far so good.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because, for the money, it's a good device. If you want a higher end dash-cam then you'll have to pay for one.der the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet.

Took less than 4 minutes.<br />2⃣ Requires a micro SD card. I used this one: [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Old Version]]]. It works perfectly.<br />3⃣ Reason for the 3 stars: when attempting to press the menu button, it takes quite a while to activate. (we're talking a frustrating long time...) There are simply other dash cams out there in the same price range that work.<br />4⃣ Delay shut-off time.  I like this feature, and it shows up here and there in other dash cams as well. This features allows the camera to continue recording for 30-ish seconds after you shut off the power (your car).  Smart idea since accidents can still happen if your is at a stand-still with the ignition off.<br />5⃣ Video files: It records to AVI files that play natively on a Mac. This is nice because other dash cams I've tested record to a weird codec (still AVI video though) and have to be converted prior to playing.  If you can't play the video files, use VLC Player (free download).<br /><br />If you're curious every 60 seconds of footage uses about 200mbs of memory.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />- No, not really. There are other more reliable options out there in the same price range.",08-04-2015,1438641938,201.72.30.173

It was a Pioneer AVH-X5700BHS for my 2010 Ford F150.  I wanted to be able to play videos for my kids on long trips but have a NAV and backup camera.  I didn't want to spend a large amount on headrest monitors nor did I want to install a over head DVD console.<br /><br />I came across the DITOP TFT LCD monitors by mistake for $19.99 each and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />When they arrived I was quite impressed by them.  The came with a bracket plate that you can use to cut and install in your headrest yourselves and there is also a bracket included that will allow you to install it on flat surfaces.<br /><br />I did not want to cut my headrests out just in case they were to be bad.  I also didn't want to mount them to a flat surface.  Then I remembered I purchased some headrest mounts for our iPad/Android tablets because I didn't want to buy a DVD player.  After looking at the headrest brackets that came with the DITOP LCD monitors and the tablet mounts I decided to modify the tablet mount to receive the DITOP LCD bracket.<br /><br />I removed the bracket plate and ran the wiring down the opening around my headrest posts to one central location under a seat.  The instructions for the LCD lack installation instructions.  They only go over the buttons on the screen and the remote.<br /><br />The wiring comes with a red/fused line, blue, and black.  I believe that the red line is constant and the blue is switched.  The black was obviously ground.  I ended up putting the red/blue together and connecting them to a 12v plug that I could manually plug in and out because they are constantly on in standby.<br /><br />After about an hour install of running lines and carefully placing them inside and under the seats I was finally able to test them.<br /><br />I was amazed of the quality they showed.  I think these would make a great addition to any vehicle.  I recommend them.  I included installation pictures.es.",08-02-2015,1438484010,222.227.147.201

""current pace"" explanation here!","i have had this watch for about 3 months now. i have never owned any other type of gps enable watch before this one. however, my father owns the forerunner 305 and my mother has the forerunner 405 so i do still have some experience with those watches as well. in my opinion this is the best watch of the group hands down. the watch literally feels like a standard stopwatch. no extra weight, no extra bulk. the 405 does not quite fit like a normal watch due to the antenna extending down into the wrist strap. this watch is extremely comfortable to wear at all times and very adjustable in size (the holes go around the entire strap). this watch is very basic for runners and thus lacks the extra bells and whistles that the 305 and 405 have such as &#34;ghost&#34; trainers and &#34;breadcrumb&#34; directions. however this watch gives you current pace (more in just a moment), distance, calories, time, heart rate, and chimes at each &#34;lap.&#34; for a standard running regimen this watch is more than enough to supplement a good, hard workout.<br /><br />CURRENT PACE EXPLANATION<br />-i have noticed a lot of confusion about the idea of this watch lacking current &#34;real-time&#34; pace. However, to be quite honest, &#34;real time&#34; pace on a gps watch is pretty useless. the gps in the watch is NOT hooked up to a satellite CONTINUOUSLY. no gps in the world has this capability. instead, each gps has a certain &#34;ping&#34; time to send and receive a signal from a satellite. more advanced gps systems have quicker &#34;pings&#34; to more closely mimic a continuous connection but the connection is still never actually continuous. on watches that advertise &#34;current pace,&#34; the watch is simply showing you the exact speed at which you were going between the last two pings. basically the watch calculates the distance traveled between each ping and then uses the time it took you to go that distance to get a speed. this leaves a lot of room for random spikes and troughs in the data. no human can run at a single speed across a certain distance. the human body simply cannot set itself to &#34;cruise&#34; and go from there. thus a &#34;real time&#34; pace is fairly useless for a runner. let me give an example. if someone were to turn on their forerunner 405 and set it to show current pace and run for 20 seconds at an 8:00min/mi pace, assuming the watch has a ping every 2 seconds or so, the data would look something like this: 6:52, 7:20, 8:15,7:47, 8:30, 6:59, 8:02, 8:10, etc...obviously this data is not really constant with an 8:00min/mi pace however the person may still very well be able to hit EXACTLY an 8:00min mile. What the forerunner 110 does, rather than show the data from EACH ping, is it takes each ping and adds it to a list with every other ping that has been recorded across the time frame and averages them all together. the final number that is shown on your watch will thus be called the &#34;current AVERAGE pace.&#34; which in all honesty is MUCH more useful if one is trying to hit a certain pace goal. basically this current average pace can quite accurately depict your mile split well before you've reached the mile marker..if you speed up significantly then the ping data will thus be in a lower range and bring your &#34;average&#34; time down. now some of you might think that this means that the watch only displays a pace that doesnt refresh very often. however, the exact opposite is true. the watch will refresh the current average pace every time another ping comes in..so basically your current average pace could hypothetically move up or down with every single ping. but due to the beauty of the AVERAGE, the watch will not jump around sporadically like in a &#34;current pace&#34; but rather stay around a certain time and gradually move up or down according to your speed. in essence, the &#34;current pace&#34; on a lot of gps watches is really truly useless and most people will never end up using it because it doesnt actuallygive you any solid data to work off of. because the data is changing so dramatically each second, the data is just plain useless. FYI: some runners may have noticed very random spikes in their &#34;fastest&#34; pace that the garmin software will show after uploading the data. basically, &#34;fastest pace&#34; during your run means that for one single ping during the run you might have run a 5:34min/mile pace for all of 1 second. however, because that pace is still part of the data that is added into the overall time, it still counts as your &#34;fastest pace&#34; for the run even though your average mile pace for the workout was only 8:34...<br /><br />another nice thing about this watch is that after each run is saved to the history on the watch, it can be accessed to show the average pace over the entire distance rather than just the mile splits. the mile splits for older runs can only be accessed and viewed once the watch is connected to a computer and the data is uploaded.<br /><br />hope all of this has cleared up any confusion about current average pace for the forerunner 110!",08-02-2015,1438496544,193.197.63.106

This product set's  up is very simple and easy. Clip camera to windshield mount, plug in the power cable which has a micro USB that goes to the camera and standard USB on the supply side. If your car is not equipped with a USB charging port it comes with the cigarette lighter adapter. A micro SD card is necessary,but not included, for recording. The suction cup mounting is extremely strong and I have no concern that it will fall off, even in extreme weather. The angles in the description are accurate, and it picks up a clear image in that range. There is no infrared, so what you get at night on dark roads is only what your headlights illuminate. Video is easy to retrieve with the micro SD memory card.",08-01-2015,1438379832,196.146.85.239

Solid speaker for under 50$...,"Was instantly impressed when I synced this to my phone and first started playing some tunes. It's loud, clear, and there's a decent amount of bass. However, don't be expecting anything room shattering; it's got just enough 'thump' to have a balanced sound.<br /><br />Really, though, the quality of sound this thing puts out is just impressive. I sat it side by side with my 130$ Creative Sound Blaster AXX 200, and it was going toe to toe. I honestly think, at the end of the day, the Sentey sounds better. It just has a 'fuller' sound to me. The Creative arguably has clearer highs and mids, but the Sentey's got it beat in bass. And overall, it just sounds less 'tinny' than the Creative.<br /><br />GREAT bang for your buck at its current price. This speaker sounds like it should at least cost 50 or 60$. It's a great buy for a budget bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />I've been investigating Sentey more and more lately after seeing how many products they have on Amazon and all the great reviews they've been getting. Apparently they are a US founded company, which is awesome. However, when perusing their website, I see a lot of grammatical and spelling errors common in foreign hired help. Whether they outsource their media building or not, that is somewhat concerning coming from a company claiming to reside in Florida. Who knows... maybe they are a bunch of American orientals?? Lol<br /><br />Still, the quality of this speaker is on par for what you pay. It's solid. Feels durable. It's quite hefty in the hand, and has a nice rubber finish for a good grip on the outside. The buttons are large and easy to see and are touch sensitive.<br /><br />Overall... a great buy! This thing puts out more sound than it should!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it for it's current price (33$).",08-01-2015,1438429987,223.194.27.104

I find it to have a strong mounting, with endless adjustments, and to be suitable for a wide range of tablets.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a coupon that covered the cost of this product, so that I could review it. I did order it from Amazon.<br /><br />The device clips onto one side of the headrest pole (as seen on the product page). The designers have done an excellent job in making this a \\""universal\\"" mount. I found that based on my measurements, it will fit any tablet with a height of 5.5 inches up to 8 inches. This would be measured at the narrowest part of the tablet. The arms that hold the tablet have a spring control to hold snugly and yet release easily as well, while the main section extends and then locks into place. There are rubberized pads on top and bottom. The device has knobs for all places that tighten, so it is really easy to mount and adjust. I was worried when I saw the design that it might not hold the tablet well, but in fact it does fine. At first, the poles at the top went over the power button on my Android tablet, but even the top feet can be moved, so it worked out. I am impressed by the ingenuity that went into this unit - well done!<br /><br />There are a couple of things to consider when ordering. You must have bare support poles for this to work, and the poles need to be straight, not curved. So if you are a short person, this would not work on your seat because the headrest would be snug against the seat. Mine had a small bend on both sides, but there was still enough straight pole for the mount to work. Also, the headrest needs to be at least 2 inches above the seat back. In my case, the head rest was just barely high enough above the seat so that the tightening knob would still work. Do the measurements before you order to make sure your car will work: straight support poles, with the head rest at least 2 inches above the seat.<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended..<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended.",7/31/2015,1438297999,199.193.109.197

I had purchased a different type before buying this one but I didn't realize the other style was for the sports bands that lay flat. I have the melanise loop which will not lay flat. This raised option is perfect. There is only one con I've found with this product and that is that they added an indent for the cord to go but it will not stay because of the length of the connecting piece to the battery charger. For me that's not a deal breaker. But for those who must have the cord tucked away you may need to pull out a drill and angle the hole differently at the top to make it work or find some decorative tape to embellish and hide it. It's a handsome and sleek. I anticipated it to look cheap but I was pleasantly surprised. It also has a decent weight where it won't move or turn over easily.,7/31/2015,1438296196,217.47.63.2

Well actually, &#34;we&#34; don't misplace things, it's some &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; that moves them someplace else from were &#34;we&#34; put them. :)  Nice loud sound from the receivers and the flashing led is easy to see in dim light.  The flashlight on the transmitter is neat and provides a pretty good beam.  Receivers are nicely constructed and have thick support around the ring hole, was able to use a larger ring than the tiny ones supplied.  Broadcast distance was very/very good.  Tested by letting wife hide a receiver.  I started downstairs, other side of house, with receiver &#34;hidden&#34; in a desk drawer upstairs on the far side of the house. Approx. distance 20 meters through maybe 3 interior walls. I could not hear the 'beep' but my wife said 'it' beeped.  In wandering around until I finally heard it.  Didn't take too much to finally narrow a possible room location.  My ears might not give an exact location of where the sound came from but I knew it had to in there somewhere. Just simply started opening drawers and pressing the button.  Found it!!  Total time: about 5-6 minutes whereas I've spent what seemed like hours retracing steps and tearing apart the house looking. Cons: If receiver is laying totally flat, colour up, the sound is muffled because the speaker is on the back.  Wish there was a 'replacement face' or overlay for the transmitter to write down what each colour ID was assigned to.  Heck, if I can't remember where something is at,  HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME to remember what each colour represents???  Is that expecting too much from me? ;) ;)  [I know, I know - tape a cheat sheet on the back of the transmitter.] Problem not encountered yet:  How do I find the transmitter if that darn &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; hides it on me?

This did give me a warning, however, as with all radar detectors, the issue is, for me at least, i like to have my music, relatively loud,and therefor cannot hear any sort of radar detector. The normal solution to this is the light up display, however when i am on unfamiliar roads with people who apparently got their license back when they were just giving them away.... (Yea im talking about most of the people that drive the 495 beltway) The last thing i would do would be to look down frequently to check the radar detector.<br /><br />So in my 300 mile testing, i found that highway mode worked reasonably well, with the occasion &#34;false&#34; alarm. I say false in quotations because i fully believe it picked up some signal from the k band, it just wasn't a warning i cared about. Many programmable road signs, will send an alert for instance.<br /><br />Best i can tell this detects h,x,k,KA,Str La bands. What any of them are i have no clue though the road signs that triggered alerts were all on the K band.<br /><br />However in city mode i surprised that this did not go bananas as they used to when close to a stores theft detection tag sensors at the door.<br /><br />The unit comes with a clear gel grip pad to help hold the unit in place, a car adapter that features an on and off button, instructions in both russian and english, and of course the radar detector.<br /><br />It is nice and low profile so it wasnt so blatantly obvious it was there despite sitting in the middle of my dash. The unit features a nice small display that shows what band it is detecting as well as the signal strength to help you gauge distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.<br /><br />The speaking, if i caught it correctly said&#34; position ahead&#34; in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)<br /><br />I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.<br /><br />Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review. MY ratings never remotely consider that factor, I rely to much on reviews from time to time when buying products to give something a positive rating because its free. However I  do consider the list price on amazon for some items to keep it all in context. For instance, you shouldn't expect a BMW for the price of a Chevy.<br /><br />If this review helped you , please click on the little link below, so i know i am hitting the things you need to know and that my reviews are helping people.

I have used it now for about 3 weeks. I love having the functionality of an Android tablet in my head unit. I use my phone as a mobile hotspot so I can use Maps, Waze, Pandora, etc. UPDATE: the Wi-Fi functionality often does not work and for 5-10 minutes after start. Screen Mirroring DOES NOT WORK, and since this is the most advertised function, I was tempted to send it back (to China). I have tried connecting a Note 4, S3, Galaxy Tab, and Kindle Fire with no success. :( If I do get it to work I will update this. I am able to use my steering buttons. The functionality of the radio application is not user friendly and it sounds horrible for all but the strongest signal stations, but I don't use the radio much anyway. The boot up time is about 1-2 minutes and reconnecting the Wi-Fi connection each trip can be even slower. If I want to listen to Pandora on a 5 minute trip to the store, I will spend most of the route in silence trying to get it to start :( There is no included documentation. There is a pdf installed in the unit, but it is difficult to understand and of little use. I assume the advertised functionality of dimming the display when headlights are on would work if it were wired properly, but how to do so is not apparent. I have not figured out how to connect the old LCD that sits on top or if that would work. The USB flash drive is not limited to 16GB, I connected a 128 GB thumb drive with no problem. :) I have not found the advertised option of changing the 86 opening logo splash screen nor changing between 9 LED button lighting colors :(  Overall, I still like the functions that the stock radio doesn't have, but I am disappointed in the advertised functions that don't work.  Installation tips: 1) loosen the side brackets on the HU to allow the holes of the LCD module on top to align to the holes in the side brackets. 2) if the bottom of the unit does not sit flush intothe environmental control module below, you may have to (carefully) remove the while clips from your old unit to use in the GA5151.",7/30/2015,1438254731,215.121.138.180

It was the only reasonable BT transmitter with digital/Toslink input which I needed to convert a TV's output to a BT signal (the TV, a Toshiba, does not have analog audio output, as odd as that seems). When I first tried to buy this item (the Andoer), Amazon said the soonest it would arrive was after I was to leave for the weekend (where the device was to be installed as part of a gift), for whatever reasons 2 day or 1 day prime shipping wasn't available.<br /><br />So I bought the seemingly identical item branded as &#34;LingsFire&#34; (at $5 more) because 2 day shipping was an option for that item. That unit arrived in 2 days (a day before leaving for the weekend), but the power supply didn't work (it put out 1.7V instead of the required 5V) and the device/box itself never powered-on even when used with a verified good power supply. So I started the return/refund process for that product (which perhaps coincidentally, appeared to have been previously opened and re-sealed/taped).<br /><br />I then searched again on Amazon and now free 1-day shipping was available for the Andoer-branded version of this device! So I purchased it and crossed my fingers. It arrived at 6pm the following day and we made the boat for our weekend trip where the device was to be installed along with a JBL Flip 2 speaker for my hard-of-hearing father to watch/hear the television without bothering everyone else in the house.<br /><br />I tested the new (Andoer) power-supply (it put out 5v) and device/unit quickly (the blue LED came on and blinked) and then packed it up along with the BT speaker for our trip.<br /><br />PAIRING:<br />I read the directions for both devices, but could not get them to pair. I sat and stared and read and re-read and tried different BT speakers. Finally, I decided to hold down the power button for like 10 seconds and finally the LED flashed quickly alternating between red and blue. *This* is the pairing mode. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode. Anyway, once I discovered this, it was smooth-sailing and everyone is very happy.<br /><br />I do wish there was less lag/latency however: there's really no way, at least with this TV, to eliminate the delay between the audio coming out of the TV's built-in speakers and those coming from the BT speaker. So we just disable or turn-down the TV's speakers, but that may not be an option for everyone.de. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode.

It didn't support all the accessibility options than Android KitKat devices are supposed to support, like disabling unwanted touchscreen gestures.  After 26 days, it stopped working. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs with their support website. I can't get a clear answer, and I can't file a rma request while the website's broken, but I think they want me to ship this to Eindhoven for repairs, and pay them to ship it back.

I love that I can use this speaker while cleaning around the house. I can grab this and my phone and move from one room to the next easily. The speaker is very compact and lightweight and doesn't take up any space at all so I can put it on a shelf, dresser, or counter somewhere while I clean. The sound quality is actually really impressive for the size. There is no distortion and you can actually hear the bass coming from the song. You can also answer phone calls and use the speaker as a hands free speaker. The sound on the other end of a phone call is nice and clear as well. I had no problems hearing someone on the other end and they had no problems hearing me. I also like the fact that I can connect devices through an AUX cable or put a USB flash drive in the speaker to play music. It even has a built in antenna and radio!

So I will share it with you........ The power cord has 3 wires, (black) ground – (yellow) B+ and (Red) ACC. Then there is the other wire that is to connect the rear camera “a plug type of connection”.  The easiest way to connect the power in thru the fuse box.  The red and yellow wires are connected to 2 - 15amp fuses (1 on each wire) the yellow (B+) goes to a constant power supply. My Hazard lights use a 15amp fuse and it always has power whether or not the car is turned on, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the yellow wire. And the Red (ACC) needs a power source that shut off when the key is removed, so… my cigarette lighter will not work when the car is turned off and it uses a 15amp fuse, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the red wire. And the black (ground) connects to the metal frame…..anywhere is fine, but not connect to the fuse box………….just in case you come into contact with live wires. I haven’t tried to hook up the rear camera but I’m assuming that the red wire on the rear camera is to be hooked up to your back-up light, not sure didn’t do any research on it. The reason I didn’t give the product 5 stars is because I had to search the web to find out where the wires go, other than that…………..I love it, it works great…….once I got the power installed. :-)",7/26/2015,1437893604,202.116.137.2

This ZEN was purchased after my original took an unfortunate two feet drop straight onto concrete while it was playing and died an instant, hopefully painless death. I attempted to repair the device afterward by purchasing and installing a new hard disc. Unfortunately this never ended up solving the problem, so after that 40 dollars thrown away I decided to purchase a refurbished model online.<br /><br />It came packaged in a smaller version of something like the original ZEN packaging. If you're like me, you could immediately tell it was refurbished because it had been super-glued shut somehow. I tried my damnedest to open up the case to try my hard disc in it, still trying to troubleshoot the old one and see if I had purchased a faulty disc or if it was some other issue with my original. No doing - it remained glued shut and I didn't want to press my luck, so I left it.<br /><br />Has all the design limitations and benefits as the original. Same wonderful weight in your hand, same easily manipulated interface, same software limitations (when I buy a new mp3, it's going to be able to play FLAC files). It's always had an average to good sound quality for what it is, and a massive amount of storage for everyone with massive music collections. This refurbished model seems to have a shorter battery life than my original, but not enough to complain about. Overall it's a fair purchase, and I expect it'll last me another several years before I replace it with some super new non-Apple product.",7/25/2015,1437811655,211.97.173.121

They are perfect for using with a power bank (iXCC offers many kinds--check them out) or for using them with an action cam such as the SJ4000 (which I personally use them for). It is a basic microusb cable, theres nothing special about it other then it being super short! I have used this cable for a few weeks now and during that period it has endured numerous bends, pulls, drops, and baby slobber! The cable works just perfect. I appreciate iXCC not overdoing it with branding. While there is some branding they when with branding that blends in well. I applaud them for that.<br /><br />Speed wise its rated for up to 480mbps, pretty much the standard for usb cables so you will get your standard results.<br /><br />The quality is there like all other iXCC products. I was a bit worried about my 9 month olds slobber when she got ahold of it. I have had cables in the past either A) stop working or B) start messing up and then later corrode. She had this thing almost entirely in her mouth for a good 5 minutes (yes I know, bad parent.. I was busying looking on Amazon!) and once I pulled it out I just wiped it down with a baby wipe and let it dry.<br /><br />I would recommend this cable if you use power banks and your device accepts microUSB or if you own a goPro or action camera. No reason to have those 3 foot cables when you are using your device right next to a battery or computer.<br /><br />Discount provided for review.",7/23/2015,1437661617,195.134.133.227

This bluetooth device is one of the best I have ever tried and used! This SoundPal is a small cube but it packs a huge sound and a bunch of awesome features!<br /><br />The SoundPal connected easily to my bluetooth devices. The sound goes through clear and you can hear all of the details extremely well. This speaker can also play really loud for its' size without losing quality.<br /><br />The connection strength is also quite good. I can easily go 30 feet in the line of sight without a problem. With items and walls blocking the connection you can't go quite as far but still a good distance.<br /><br />There is an on/off, play/pause/bluetooth, volume up, volume down buttons.One of the coolest features is that you can use this speaker with so many devices wether they are bluetooth or not. You can plug your phone or computer in using an auxiliary cord or you can even play music or files off of a micros card! This is awesome because you can load your music on to a card and this is one of the best portable speakers on the market for its' size!<br /><br />I haven't tried the microphone yet but I will update when I do. Charging is done using a micros cord (same as most android phones use).<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing portable speaker or stand alone music player if you add a micro-sd card.

The first the connector broke and the second I returned to Amazon because it could not be recogized as being plugged into my computer - the later I will explain ( please read).  Just returned from trip 7/21/15. On the way out I thought it did a better job of street names, etc than that garmins. Programing it for trips is pretty easy as well. I will say if you do not have the actual STREET address you have issues because its programed for STATE, CITY, STREET, ADDRESS. I did realize just today that you can go to POI and it list hotels and then you can just type in the hotel name for the city so that's cool. Easier to do on the Garmin's.  Pros: easy to program, Cheap, life time maps whatever that means.  Cons: this is the big negative for me. Street names. What good does it do to tell me the name when I'm in the turn? This past trip I missed a lot of turns because it did not announce the street name in advance. My Garmin's had a large box at the top of the screen showing the name of the street. This has a small box on the right that one has to seriously take there eyes off the road to read and for those two reasons I would not purchase this. The third reason was the graphic display. I spent a lifetime designing training materials and working in Powerpoint to create slides and I couldn't have chosen worse colors then they came up with. If you can see the cross streets your eyes are better than mine. Horrible washed out background.   Note: It did announce in advance major highways like ' turn left ahead on US 2 but not streets in towns. To be honest we just got smart phones and played with the GPS in our town and its no comparison to either the Garmin or Tom Tom. Need to find a bracket to hang it on then I'm done with both Garmin and Tom Tom.  Last: Both of my Garmins and my new Tom Tom were not recognized by computer as being plugged in thus, you cannot update maps or charge the darn thing. Found out how to get aroundit. You know this is a big issue when both companies have a page of instructions to try. My guess, MS doesn't like these new products and so there is a compatibility issue here.  1. Go into My Computer 2. Go into Devices 3. Find Tom Tom or your device name 4. Click on the Windows box and select 'activate or whatever the word is. This should now start the communication process.

The ipod coppied spinwheel is just for decorations you must click buttons to do anything. The instructions would be useless because there is so little to them and much is needed because despite having only 5 buttons navigating is confusing until you get the hang of it. However the instructions on the inside are just wrong. You might as well throw it away because it will be easier to figure out on your own. It will take time to figure all the options out too. Some buttons i cant even tell if they work or when they work. Navigating the different folders (bands/singers) is annoying and a crapshoot to find out if songs will replay over and over. I have found that starting from the beginning works well but if you want to skip a song you have to click the skip button for each song.<br />the pros...a 64gb mp3 player for under $30. The sound is average and the equalizer helps but if you are looking for premium sound this isnt it.<br />the setup to put music on from my wmp was quick and easy. I am not sure if i got an exclusive deal but for the money i paid and for what i use it for (at work where it can potentially break easily) it was a steal. If i compare it to the ipod that it is trying to copy then it is garbage.<br />my advice is if you dont mind figuring out menus then this is for you. If you want to play the music you want when you want and easily navigatethe menus then this is not for you. If you have to pay retail price there are better options.,7/21/2015,1437423259,198.187.22.34

Don't let that stop you from buying one though.  There is nothing similar as far as size/weight/2m and 440 from ICOM, Kenwood or Yaesu.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot for the price but as it turns out I really like it.  For a small car this is the perfect size (a bit bigger than a radar detector).  Mine puts out 25 watts towards the top of the 2m band and ~23 or 24 at the bottom (my meter is just a cheapo with a swing needle so not super accurate but good enough).  The low power setting doesn't seem to work, other reviews and youtube videos confirm this.  It would be nice to have the feature to save battery power and generate less heat.  Speaking of heat, it does get warm but nothing crazy.  Short repeater chats kept the temp on the heat sink at about 125 degrees (measured with a non-contact thermometer), rag chewing on simplex with another guy for an hour or more and the temp got to 140.  I think if you were going to do a bunch of simplex it might be good to stick a small fan on the heat sink but honestly it'll get hotter inside my car parked in the sun.  The mic is solid feeling and a very good copy of a Kenwood mic right down to the silk screening on the boards.  The key layout is different though.  Modulation is a little low but not terrible.  Better than the Baofeng HTs at least.  I haven't seen a pin out diagram for this mic yet but I might try swapping in another mic.  EDIT: Its a Kenwood pinout.    Sound is good but not great (its a pretty small speaker) but it does get nice and loud without becoming very distorted.  I think this would make it a nice choice for use in a soft top Jeep or other noisy cabin vehicle.  Some low reviews here because of programming issues.  If you have fooled around with a Baofeng or any of the other china radios you should be ok.  If your experience is only with the big 3 japanese manufacturers or you've never programmed a radio before fret not, the Miklor site has a good step by step to do it manually (this is the same radio as the QYT 8900).  Of note even if you set the offset you'll still need to punch in the tx freq as well.  I wouldn't suggest trying to punch in a repeater while driving (which I can easily do on my other radios) but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to program all the local repeaters in there and be set.  It would not be my first choice for a long road trip for this reason.  I suspect that CHIRP will support it before too long (it is pretty new to the market after all). But even if they don't the factory software can be downloaded at the Miklor site.  Honestly if there was a Kewood or other big name radio with similar features/size/power output I would have bought that instead.  But I can't complain, the price is great and it works quite well.  I get great signal reports coupled with a 1/4 wave mag mount and the whole thing is easy to move around (rental car, truck driver etc etc).  73s",7/19/2015,1437266990,193.243.185.117

Light as a feather, clipped it on my collar and had my music wherever I went. Then it started mysteriously turning itself off. At first I thought it had just run out of batteries, so I went home and charged it. It worked fine again for another few days, then the problem suddenly got really bad. I would turn the player on and it would load up the home screen, but as soon as I pressed ANY button, it would shut off. I also tried not pressing anything just to see what would happen: it consistently turned itself off after about 20 seconds. I also tried resetting the device and updating the firmware; no improvement.<br /><br />I checked some online forums, and found out that apparently this is a problem with all of the Sansa Clips. It's only a small percentage that have this problem, but if you happen to get one of the bad ones, there's nothing you can do. Even worse, it shows up at random times: some people had their Clip for months before it started malfunctioning. So if yours is working reliably now, that doesn't mean it will keep working in the future. This is all based on what they're saying in the forums; I don't know if it's totally accurate. All I know is my Clip+ became completely unusable after two weeks.<br /><br />Very annoying, but at least the seller gave me a full and timely refund. They didn't even ask me to ship the product back -- which I guess makes sense, since it's pretty much a paperweight at this point.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk.",7/18/2015,,

And the reaction of my 10 year old son: &#34;Wow!  You can really hear the bass.  Awesome!&#34;  Any gripes or problems and I will update this initial review.  I bought this primarily as a companion for our camping trips and other outings with friends (beach, park days, hikes around the county).  My son is increasingly interested in music and sharing it with friends is one way he is expanding his ability to participate in social gatherings and up his comfort level considerably.  The sound of this speaker compared to a smaller one we have owned for awhile is night and day, and for a not significant increase in expense.  Sometimes it pays to be a little behind the curve in tech but this speaker appears to be solidly built and a good solution for adding a soundtrack to outings in semi-remote areas or even around the house.  I'm hoping the bright color (red) will aid in keeping it handy and handling it carefully so it will last longer.",7/18/2015,,

It still try's to ask you for state when there are none.  And what I really did not like is that you have to enter the house number first, then the street then the city.  Well that's kinda backwards especially when countries are so close together.  Let's try the country first, then the city then the street.  All I know is that it was not straight forward. You have to go to the upper right corner and do a &#34; search near&#34; to get closer into the country before you can proceed.   Having said all that, the maps themselves were very accurate and the directions, once finally in there, were spot on. It was really very helpful.  I just wish it was more intuitive in adding the addresses in Europe versus the U.S.  Secondly this model has an annoying feature that cannot be turned off.  I live near a school zone.

Starting with the design, there is nothing intuitive about using this device. No matter how you're intending to get your music to the device (sd card, usb, bluteooth), ultimately the point is that it's going to be playing through your radio, so the FM setup is key. This is really tricky to configure and takes a while to get used to. The current station is not displayed, rather you get a really helpful &#34;bt&#34; or &#34;hi&#34; displayed. What station am I on? &#34;bt&#34; Cool. To change the station, or even see the station, you have to press and hold the button on the right. This will not just display but will move the station up 1. If you want to move the station down, you have to hold the button on the right, moving it up one, then quickly use the left button to move the station down before it goes back to the helpful &#34;bt&#34; display. Long press the left button to move it down? Nope. That's just short press (again, only after long pressing the right button.)<br /><br />Several red lights run and cyclists ran over later, I at least had figured out  how to get it to the right station. The pros, well the sound is about as good as you can expect from these types of devices, I've used worse so that was nice. However, and what I'm most disappointed about, is that once you overcome the poor design, the device just doesn't work. The bluetooth connection breaks on average of once per album. On a ten hour road trip, probably 7 or 8 times the music just stopped randomly, and I had to turn it off, turn it back on again, and connect the bluetooth. Again, all things you want to be doing while driving.",7/17/2015,,

Plugged in with the $0.01 quality cable they sent was just as bad, meaning Bluetooth was not the problem. Unplugging the power supply made me at first think it was the problem, but whoops, ten seconds later, static comes again. That 10 seconds was long enough to hear that the qaulity of the thing was trash.<br /><br />And as for it's looks? The &#34;wood.&#34; Yeah, it ain't wood. The stupid lights are dumb too.

I didn't even charge this when I received it - I used it right away. I have a Nokia Lumia 1020 (Windows) phone and the speaker connected through bluetooth very fast. I'm semi-pleased with the sound (I had to put my volume all the way up) as it does give a nice sound quality. I used Spotify with this and when I wanted to change a song the button on the speaker (the arrow ones) changed the song without problems! My phone was far away too which is nice to have it not near the bathtub.<br />I must note that the speaker sometimes will fall off from its suctioning within half an hour or so if I suction it really high on the bathtub wall. Sound is much better when it's on the floor of the bathtub though...<br />Also, I tested calling my phone using my dad's phone and clicking the phone button answered his call. I could hear him with decent volume, however, he said that on his line he can hear me garbled.<br />All in all, this is a great bluetooth shower speaker for listening to music.

However I ran into a number of technical issues which detract from what could have been a nice dash cam.<br /><br />The first unit I received could not advance past the \\""""welcome\\"""" page.  The return and replacement was easy as anything on Amazon.<br />The second unit records without problems, however many of the files on the micro sd are not viewable. The error reads \\""""The format of xxx.mov cannot be detected.\\""""  This is a serious problem because unlike many cameras that save small files often this camera saves large files, so if something goes wrong when it saves the entire recording sessions is lost.<br /><br />By trial and error I determined the video files are not saved correctly related to how the dash cam is stopped.  It appears that if I disconnect USB power and let it run for a few minutes on internal battery until it runs out of juice it saves the file the file is saved fine and they can be played back.  However if I stop recording by just turning off ignition in the car (which is what I have always done with the other dash cams) the file is not saved properly and is corrupted. I also was not able to read the file when I used on/off button to turn off the unit itself prior to turning off ignition.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />✔ Video quality of the dash cam is quite good as you can see in attached video.<br />✔ This camera has an excellent suction cup mount, stayed on even on rough roads.<br />✔ The dash cam uses standard micro USB cables.<br />✔ The cam has an LED display so I can tell that the cam is aimed correctly.  The display flashes a bit as you drive, I have not seen this with the older dash cams we own.<br />✔ Recording starts as soon as it gets power so you don't have to remember to turn it on.<br /><br />The AmorTek package includes the camera, two mini USB cables, and cigarette lighter USB adapter.<br /><br />The user interface is straightforward and even though the manual does not contain details for each button and each option, it contains a picture where each button's function is labelled. I found the manual sufficient to configure my video cam. All defaults are reasonable.<br /><br />Overall, this dash cam has good potential but appears to be an early version which still has some technical issues to iron out especially with reliable saving of files.<br /><br />This video cam is provided by AmorTek.

The price was right for this item so I purchased it.<br /><br />First off, a few tools are helpful.  I found that a metric tape measure, soldering gun, round file, fish tape and cable ties made the job much neater and professional looking.<br /><br />The included instruction sheet is worth looking at even though you can install the system without it. There are optimal height and spacing recommendations as well as an acceptable range between the sensors listed on the sheet. I was able to get the height perfect but the spacing between the sensors was just not possible on the Escape. Reinforcements and brackets on the back of the plastic bumper cover were in the way so I had to compromise. I have a little bit of a blind spot if there is something like a pole or other thin vertical item centered behind me. Since I mounted the display on top of the rear view mirror that should not be too much of an issue as I can use the mirror and display together.<br /><br />To start the installation I laid everything out in the back of the SUV, connected all sensor and display cables and spliced the power wire into the backup light to test the system. Note I did not cut the vehicle wire but shaved off a quarter inch of the insulation, separated the strands of both wires, fed and twisted the power wire through the shaved section and soldered the power wire in. Very sleek and secure. A couple of weeks after doing this I found some Scotchlok T-Tap terminals just made for splicing inline. I will use them when I wire up my trailer hitch.<br /><br />Next I put some blue painter's tape on the bumper and experimented with the layout of the sensors. This took much longer than I anticipated but I wanted it to be as functional and good looking as possible.<br /><br />When I was happy with the layout I drilled pilot holes in the plastic and then used the hole saw (included with the kit) to make the holes. Drilling in plastic is easy and it's important to drill slowly. Plastic can melt fairly quickly if the hole saw gets hot. The tape was removed before drilling with the hole saw. You want the holes to be nice and neat because the sensors don't have a lot of play in the mount. A fine round file cleaned up the burrs left behind from the hole saw.<br /><br />The sensors were mounted in the plastic and I started feeding the wires from the driver's side over to the passenger side where I planned on running the wires up into the interior. Cable ties were used to keep things neat. A little extra care had to be taken on the passenger side because of the muffler. Not too difficult, but no sense melting anything.<br /><br />The wires were fed up through a vent which is where I wanted to mount the control box. That was not bad.<br /><br />I drove it like this for a week before attempting to mount the display. I really wanted it above the mirror which meant running the wire above the headliner but thought it would be too difficult. In reality it was a piece of cake. I dropped the interior""",,5,

I installed it on my secondary vehicle so I haven't tested it at night but I can say it works well during the day.  The viewing angle of the camera is pretty good and the picture on the monitor is sharp.  The power wires on the camera and screen are very thin, so you have to be careful when stripping the wires and connecting them.  All of the wiring is of a good length and should be enough for most vehicles.  I installed mine on a Nissan King Cab Frontier pickup and both the power wires and camera cable reach comfortably with some extra to spare.  The camera comes on right away when shifting into reverse and shuts off right away after shifting out of reverse.  The camera does catch the sunlight and the glare reduces the viewing a bit, but it is still useable.  The product doesn't come with any useable installation instructions but a little bit of know-how will get the job done.  Crawling under the truck and routing the camera cable was the only difficult part. :)",7/16/2015,1437034103,214.89.24.18

I had the opportunity to purchase this radio from VeroTelecom and received it quickly. The radio was packed well and all the components were well packed and protected. The power cord is a standard mobile cord so it easily popped into my existing power supply lead, although it does come with and extremely long power cord. The radio is dual fused on the power cable near the back of the radio for good protection. The body of the radio is nice and heavy and feels very solid. nothing rattles or makes noise when you handle it so it would be great in the mobile. The display does not attach to the body of the radio and comes with a long separation cable and a suction cup mount for the control head. I wish some of my other rigs has that feature. The mic can attach both to the base of the radio or the side of the control head making your mounting options plentiful. And, should you not want the mic attached at all, there is a built in microphone in the display you can turn on and either key the radio with the PTT button on the display or set it to vox and go hands free. The control head is well constructed and feels very solid. The buttons do not rattle around like they are lose in the cover, but are nice and tight. The display is self is very large and you can see everything at a glance without having to concentrate too hard which is a bonus for mobile users so you spend less time looking at the display. The menus take a bit of getting used to but after about 5 minutes of actually reading the very well written manual you can find everything you are looking for easily. Operating the radio is very simple, whether you are running VFO or memory. Programming memories from the panel/microphone is easy as well, which is what I did. It took less than 30 minutes to learn how to program the memories and get them all stored. Not quite sure anyone would ever want or need 1000 memory channels but they are there if you need them. Local repeaters and a few simplex frequencies are all I ever need. The included DTMF microphone is nice sized, fits in the palm of my hand well, is back lit, and does not feel cheap, It is solid and does not make any crunching or plastic squeaking noises when you press the PTT button. The mic also has 4 &#34;P&#34; keys are they are called that you can set for various functions normally found in the menus. Power, squelch, repeater offset and a couple others are options to be set for each &#34;P&#34; key. I have used this radio on all bands, 2m, 220 and 440 and have received nothing but good audio reports. Don't let the 1W on 220 bother you too much, 1W does wonders with a decent antenna. I am able to get into all the local 220 repeaters just fine with a simple mag mount inside the house. Power output is select-able and consistent. The base of the radio has the usual data port and speaker jack but also has a line-in port which you can use to pass audio into the rig and you can select line-in as an option on the display as a &#34;band&#34; setting and hear the audio.

The only knock against it is that the instructions said when charging the light would turn off when full and I had it charging for a few hours and the light never turned off.

They require a break-in though.","Several decades ago, I bought my first car, and installed my first sound system in it.  It was a 70 Chevelle with a Sanyo &#34;metal&#34; tape head unit.  It was rated for 8 Ohm speakers (oddly), but could handle 4Ohm.  I installed one pair of 6 X 9&#34; 3-way Pioneer speakers on the rear deck.  I also ran thick speaker wire under the carpet.  The results were amazing.  What I didn't know at the time is that the (trunk) area was the perfect speaker enclosure to really PUSH the bass (low sounds).  And my head unit had enough power to bring the best out of those pioneers.  I was amazed.<br />Fast forward 30 years, and I buy myself a used Hyundai Sonata as a basic transportation appliance.  But I can't stand the factory sound system.  The head unit was replaced with a BOSS brand media receiver (look ma, no cd!)  But I had to replace two sets of speakers on the cheap, also.<br />I was leaning toward Pioneer brand because I knew they could make a good accurate speaker system.  But I was also on a pretty tight budget.  I was happy to find the 1645 model Pioneer 2-way 6.5&#34; speaker system for a very good price.  I wanted larger speakers but had to go with what would fit in the front door panels.<br /><br />First impression...<br />I hated them.  Although the mid-range and treble were more accurate than the factory speakers, that's not saying much.  And bass was ZERO.  Judging by ear alone, the frequency response dropped at least 10dB around 200Hz and below, which is terrible.<br />I wasn't too concerned about the lack of bass, as I still needed to order some 6 x 9 speakers for the rear deck.  I knew from experience that the 6 x 9 rear deck speakers would have PLENTY of bass...<br />Because I live overseas, I had to wait a few weeks for the 6 X 9 speakers.  During that time, I continued to use the factory speakers on the rear deck, along with the new Pioneer 6.5&#34; speakers in the front door panels<br /><br />Fast forward a few weeks...<br />One of my favorite songs came on and I cranked it up to mid-loud levels (not super loud, but enough to push a good volume of air).  I was surprised to both hear AND FEEL a super low-end response from the FRONT speakers.  My pant legs were vibrating.  That only happens when woofers move a LOT of air.  Anyway, these 1645 model speakers sound like crap UNTIL THEY ARE BROKEN IN.  After they are broken in though, they have amazing bass response.<br /><br />A few more weeks...<br />With brand new JVC 6 X 9 speakers on the rear deck (couldn't get the Pioneers here...not for a reasonable price anyway).  The JVC speakers are NOT broken in yet.  So the Pioneer 6.5&#34; speakers are still providing most of the bass...<br />I was listening to most of my favorite music and my impression of the Pioneer speakers is that they had AMAZING, accurate BASS response, as well as &#34;smooth&#34; (not irritating) and accurate treble...but where was the mid-range?  Over and over, with any type of music...my impression was the same.  The BASS is there, the TREBLE sounds very pleasing...where is the mid-range?<br />I finally figured out my head unit was mis-adjusted.  If you use the bass/treble controls to adjust the sound output of the BOSS media receiver, it seems to de-emphasize mid-range.  while this seems the way bass/treble controls SHOULD work...the end result seems to be an actual *attenuation* of the mid-range levels, as opposed to just emphasizing bass and treble over it...<br /><br />After playing around with the various controls of the Boss media receiver head unit...<br />I figured out the &#34;Rock&#34; EQ setting is the best setting for the Pioneer speakers.  With this setting, the BASS is not quite emphasized as much as I'd like it to be.  HOWEVER, the mid-range sounds beautiful and the treble is &#34;just right&#34;.  It is a well-balanced sound that you can turn up as loud as you want, without it being annoying at all...<br /><br />Bottom line, these Pioneer speakers have the potential to be very accurate sounding speakers, if you have a decent head unit that is properly adjusted.  BUT NOTE THEY REQUIRE A LONG BREAK-IN PERIOD!!!urate sounding speakers, if you have a decent head unit that is properly adjusted.  BUT NOTE THEY REQUIRE A LONG BREAK-IN PERIOD!!!",7/16/2015,1437040347,207.87.15.127

The amp itself has questionable efficiency, so I'm not sure how much power is being released as heat and how much is being put into the audio wave to the speakers, the amp kind of got warm after short usage on low volume during bench testing so i'm guessing somewhere in the 70-75% efficiency range.  This amp blew the inline 15 ampre fuse I had when the bass dropped (not the one on the amp, the fuse closer to the battery), so it's definitely pulling the power an amp like this should, it shook my rearview for the brief 2 seconds the fuse didn't break so once I have it all running properly again, this will be a great amp.<br /><br />The shipping time was longer than expected, I thought it was shipping from somewhere in the US, but it actually came from Hong-Kong and should have taken 2 months to get here, it arrive 1.5 months early (aka 2 weeks).  I bought another amp and planned to sell this when it got here, but as of now (July 16, 2015) this amp arrived before the other did.  I have woofers just laying around, I'm gonna get another enclosure and put the woofers in it and use it as an all in one unit, for now it'll sit in a box until I have everything organize.

I fish (recreationally) in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  I had to buy a separate signal splitter, otherwise I would have needed a second vhf antenna.  I do not understand why the splitter was not built into the unit.  Also, the unit does not have a switch to turn-off the transmitter, which means it transmits continuously.

I'm a cheapo, so I was looking for something that would be functional, but not put a huge dent in my pocket.  I love the removable keyboard.  It's great when lending the tablet to a niece or nephew to be able to take it off.  The keyboard is easy to pair, functional, and not so small that it's really hard to get used to typing on.  The only issue I've run into with the keyboard is that it gets really spazzy once it's battery is low.

The clips are nice and hold the tablet firmly.  I love the magnetic back stand.  The only issue I have with the case is that the outer pretend leather is a little loose from the inner fabrics in places where it bends and pulls after less than a month of use.  As a seamstress, I don't foresee the joints being an issue.  However, the fake leather under the back stand is loose and the ribbon that holds it from spread eagle-ing is only sewn to that.  I could see it being ripped off with one good yank from a small   Update - 1/2 month later:  The usb port for the keyboard literally came out.  Apparently it did not have enough support around it in order to keep it secure. The port was holding tighter to my cord than to the keyboard......could explain glitchyness.

The One Star rating is because these headphones truly last about 6-8 months before one headphone loses all sound. I went through two pairs before buying a third and realizing that there is a one-year warranty from the company. The company either doesn't honor this warranty, or it was an operator error as I tried to get through the warranty process. The phone number they provide doesn't work (there is a recording, but it goes to nothing even during their &#34;operating hours&#34;), and the form online says that you will get a response within 7 days, but I have yet to receive an email from them following up for the warranty (and I contacted them more than a month ago).  Great headphones and perfect for my small ears, but they wear out way too fast and the warranty isn't actually supported.

There are actually quite a few, and from the feedback on other products that I have read, it looks like Caska got a great one here.  I don't have any direct comparison, yet the experience of literally catapulting my old Chevy S10 on technological par with luxury vehicles makes me grin even now as I type this.<br /><br />According to feedback I have read, I guess the number one issue with others is a dim daylight reflection.  My Chevy S10 has a covered camper bed, and I have no issue with clarity or shadowing during the day and night (I don't normally drive the truck at night, but I did take it for a quick jaunt last night).  Paired up and uploaded my smartphone's contact list, and it's pretty neat having an integrated navigation.  The Samsun Galaxy S6 has a bit of a deserved reputation of being a battery hog, so I was considering putting in a wireless QI charger mound for it, but nothing I could find online would have done well in the limited spacing/configuration in my truck.  This answered all that and more, including acting as a forward/rear dashcam monitor, something I would never have had space to install separately.  Mine didn't come with a rear camera, just a forward facing internal, but I am looking for one now - I have tried a few in the past, loving being able to see below my bed gate, yet just didn't have any practical placement for a monitor except on the center hump floor (which I ended up not caring for at all).<br /><br />Being an Android OS guy, I did find the WindowsCE based UI a different feel, but everything fairly self-explanatory... which is good because the one gripe I do have is there was no installation manual included (although it is listed as being included here on the product page), and the Operating Instructions is more of a brief &#34;Quick Start&#34; pamphlet.  The full eManual is available in the system, yet I really would have liked having at least a Personal Computer PDF copy or such.  I did Google about, using various key words, looking for a web-source, but came up empty.  I would dock a star for that, but in the end, it didn't really matter.<br /><br />One of my younger brothers recently got a 2012 Jeep Wrangler, and for once it was him being green-eyed with envy (and not me over his fun Jeep compared to my old beast).  He has already firmly declared his is buying one too.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes.tart&#34; pamphlet.

I like that I can either make it quiet or loud and that is awesome.  The sound is still clear when I turn it all the way up.<br />There are two reasons that I am giving this speaker 4 star review. One is because I actually had a rough time getting it to connect with my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3. It took me about 15 minutes to get it to connect with my phone. The other is because when I am playing music and I try to turn up the sound on the speaker itself it will change to the next song because the sound buttons are also the skip buttons.

We paired it as soon as he got it and the sound quality is great. The music is so clear and it is really loud. I called him while he had the music playing and we were able to talk through the speaker. The range on it is great to, it can go up to 33 foot so you can work in the yard or garden and still be able to hear it easily. The next day he took it to work with him and played it for over 8 hours and it still had battery life to it. To charge it all we had to do was use the usb cord and plug it in for a few hours. Everyone at work kept asking him where he got it and if we could order them one. I Have to say it holds up pretty well to. My husband accidentally knocked it off the porch and I was really surprised that it didn't break and still worked perfectly.

The ELM327 chip  in this device must be a counterfeit chip. I did not open the case up to see if it were a genuine yellow ELM327 chip, but based on the fact that it doesn't work with my software and information which I found on the ELM chip manufacturer website, it is my best judgment to say that this is a fake chip. While looking for the latest driver on the Prolific software website I stumbled across the instructions for connecting the cable to a PC, which clearly state that if there is a yellow warning symbol on the com port in  device manager (in Windows) then it is most likely that the chip is a clone. Sure enough... I have the yellow warning label on both of my PCs. I attempted to hook the ELM327 up to 4 different software programs on 2 different PC without success. The software that comes with the cable does work , but is very basic and has a rather ugly interface (baud rate needs to be changed to 38400 for the port in device manager (Windows) and within the program in order for it to read the cable). I am sending my cable back and going to look for either a genuine ELM327 cable or get a stn1110, which supposedly is a superior chip set and works will all ELM327 software. Save yourself a headache and hours of messing around and buy a genuine cable.",07-09-2015,1436402369,222.2.209.156

The &#34;best&#34; thing I can say about this player, is that the radio works well, and the color is a beautiful shade of purple.  However, I'm not looking for a radio, and &#34;beautiful&#34; has zero effect on function/usefulness. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. Well, maybe a 1/2 star, for the radio.<br /><br />The player - which did arrive ahead of estimated delivery time and was nicely packaged - comes with a USB cord and earphones. The player itself is tiny (see photo of it next to iPod) - about 1 1/2&#34; X 3 1/2&#34; total and about 1/4&#34; thick. It's lighweight, cheap feeling plastic. It has a click wheel like my iPod's. The screen is about 1&#34; X 1 1/18&#34;. It's a beautiful shade of purple. The only instructions it came with, was a &#34;quick start&#34; guide, which turned out to be totally useless, and the hand drawn pictures of the player's click wheel do NOT match the actual wheel on the player or its functions, and the wheel itself was hit/miss as to what it would do when clicked.<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on my computer and connected the player to charge it.  My PC promptly flashed a message saying new hardware had been detected, and telling me it needed to be formatted.  Not good.  If you format something, it wipes out what's on there. Nope, don't want to format.  Saying no to formatting kept me from being unable to &#34;see&#34; the player on my PC.  I try unplugging/replugging the player. Same thing.<br /><br />Next, I tried looking through the device itself.  It came preloaded with 2 songs, a video, and several games.  I plugged the player into some external speakers, and was able after several attempts at manuvering the horrible click wheel, to play both songs and the video. Sound and video quality were OK, given the size of the screen. I couldn't manage the click wheel or viewing on the tiny screen, to successfully play any of the games.  The only thing I was able to make work with any consistency, was the radio.<br /><br />I never found anything on the device itself that needed to be addressed before I should have been able to load my own content via my PC. By all logic,  it shouldn't have been much different than loading music/videos onto a flash drive. After an hour of frustration, I disconnected the player and waited for my husband to get home from work.  He couldn't get the player to work either - and he has a degree in computer science!  He confirmed that formatting wipes out everything. He couldn't get the click wheel to work correctly.  He pointed out that the video formats - AMV and MTV - are obscure.  And, he wholeheartedly agrees that this player is JUNK.<br /><br />While I in no way expected this device to be anywhere near the quality of my iPod, to say that I am severely disappointed with its quality and functionality, is an understatement. It's totally useless to me. I will be contacting Amazon/the seller for a FULL refund.ality were OK, given the size of the screen.

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but I knew that I wasn't impressed with many of the speakers available at that time.  I have to say, I was beyond impressed with the BeatBlock.  The build quality was excellent, and the sound volume and quality absolutely blew away anything you could sample at the stores, even those costing twice as much.  I was amazed at the quality of sound it could produce from such a small speaker.  Music was clear, and the bass was solid.  I also found that putting it on wood, such as a wooden table or desk, would increase the quality of the low end, as the bottom firing bass speaker could use the wood surface to resonate more.  Spoken words, such as podcasts, were also very clear and loud; easily heard from one room to another, and I have used it as a speaker for presentations and adult classes I give in moderate to large sized classrooms.  I found I consistently got over 8 hours from each charge, even now, after almost 2 years of use, a charge still lasts all day.<br /><br />The exterior is a rugged rubberized finish, which has held up to a lot of moving and activity over the last 2 years.  I constantly carry it with me, and it gets banged around in my computer bag or backpack, and with even a few drops from table or desk height, and the rubber finish shows no signs of wear.  I have not exposed it to any water, so I do not know its water resistance.<br /><br />When I purchased this speaker 2 years ago, it simply blew everything else away that was available at the time.  There was no comparison.  It was far superior to the Beats line of speakers, and everyone else's speakers in the price range were trash. The small, portable bluetooth speaker market has exploded over the last couple of years, with quality companies such as JBL, Altec Lansing, and others, producing new, high quality speakers that are much improved over their previous incarnations.  I'd like to think that this product was one of the reasons why the bigger companies had to step up their games; it was just that good, and cost less than $100.  Now, you may find speakers that sound as good, but I have to say, after 2 years of hard use, this speaker was worth every penny.",07-08-2015,,

I previously owned a plug to phone unit that shorted out. I turned to this unit for ease of use, but was apprehensive. Delivery was on time and packaging was protective. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. Everything worked as advertised without exception. Pairing with my S4 was easy and permanent. My suggestion is that you turn your phone off first and reboot before you start. Ialso read of cassette deck issues which showed up on my previous (different) device. No issues there. I regularly clean the deck with a cassette designed for that use. I noticed a slight (10%) lowering of sound amplication but this was not a deal changer. I wish you the same success. One more item. The charger holds advertised power. Ine difference, I don't leave the unit in the vehicle due to the amount of heat and/or cold which could damage the unit. I also charge it at home when blinking led advises recharging. The mictophone has worked w/o issue and I have had no complaints from callers or callees. 8/1...So the trick I learned is not to leave this unit in the car during hot or cold days.

I can still use an aux cable (purchased a cheap hookup from radio shack for around $10) to connect any mp3 device and still stream my music.

The casing although was meant for the 100 Series Land Cruiser did not snap in correctly, one of the &#34;wing&#34; pieces had to be trimmed because the plastic was too big.  I would return this product if it all was not already all wired in and installed and trimmed to fit.  The wire for powering the camera is extremely cheap made, if you pull on it too much it tears the copper wires inside the rubber tubing. Camera was not coming on and I couldn't figure out why... till I noticed how easy the power wires tore, I figured out it wasn't getting power.

Knowing how a really good speaker sounds, does this speaker measure up?  Heck no!  As is typical of cheaper speakers, the treble is too forward, the mid-range is underrepresented, and the bass lacks punch.  If you turn it up loud, it will distort.  So why the 5-star review?  Because this speaker is that impressive- for the price.  It packs in connectivity to devices via Bluetooth and NFC, via microSD card, and via an Aux In port.  On-board volume/track-skip controls, play/pause, and call answer are included in the package.  It packs in a 2x3w class D amplifier, 2 full range drivers, and a passive radiator for improved bass response.  You get a built-in rechargeable battery.  And it does all of this and sounds better than it has any right to- for the price.  You're not going to use this effectively for music at a backyard barbecue, but it works just fine as a personal music listening device, and that little passive radiator pumps out a surprising amount of bass.  By no means is this a great-sounding speaker, but it is a great value.  For the price- there's an awful lot to love.",07-07-2015,,

Even at full speed the fan is noticeably quieter than two other inverters of similar size that I have.<br /><br />Good points: 1.) Will operate up to its rated output of 500 watts; 2.) It's quieter than similar inverters I'm familiar with; 3.)

If I had the means, I would buy one of every Blue Tooth Speakers on the market. I got this on sale for $9.99 and it's the best ten buck Blue Tooth speaker I've ever heard. Does it compare with my Bose Mini Link? No, but it cost 20 times less also. Does it sound bad, no way. Not bad if you are right there next to it, like at your desk. And it's got a nice feel to it. It has a good on/off switch that's easy to work, no pushing of a rubberised button that doesn't get pushed half the time. It also has a slot for a Micro SD card with MP3's on it so you could load your own music, a nice touch. It's a pretty speaker, and doesn't sound half bad, doesn't go real loud, charges with Micro USB cable (yea), and has a cool &#34;large rubber band&#34; like carrying strap. EVERYTHING that I've bought so far from Lumsing has a quality feel to it. Sounds best if backed up a few inches from a wall or something for the sound coming out of the back to bounce off of. / After playing with this speaker for a few days let me say I'm more impressed with it. The sound has gotten better with use. Some speakers seem to do this, as least to my ears. And it's a bit louder than I thought. It will fill a room that is not noisy. It has a nice clear, clean sound. The kind I like. But if you are a bass lover, this isn't your speaker. I still haven't tried puttting some songs on a Micro SD card and trying that yet, but plan to. The only think I didn't really like about this speaker is the &#34;stickers&#34; that they used for on the raised feet. Nothing bad to say about this, but I can't see them lasting very long.

Sound, Built in Mic, 3.5mm AUX Port (SK-M2, Silver)",Mobile_Electronics,3,0,0,N,N,I was amazed by the build quality of this speaker,"I was amazed by the build quality of this speaker.  The only problem its the Bluetooth.  As many others have pointed out, there is a problem with it since it starts stuttering.  Now, to be fair this is what I found so far:  It seems that Android Bluetooth in lollipop by itself have a problem. (Just search on Google), but I also found that there must be an engineering problem in the design of the speaker since it has metal all around it. (Notice that many Bluetooth non-problematic devices are mostly plastic).<br /><br />So, I purchased two to corroborate my findings. (of course, when on sale for $19.99 with code).<br />This its what I found when using it on many of my devices:<br />- On HP Slate 21 - 4.4.2 ... it works fine but it has to be no longer than 3 feet from the device.<br />- On Nexus 5.1.1 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Galaxy Note 3 - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Acer Iconia - 4.1.2 It works fine<br />- On Acer Memopad - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Nexus 7 - 5.1 - stutters until it stops working<br /><br />(Please notice the Android version for the ones that work fine)<br /><br />So, since I purchase them at such low price point, I got OKRA BTR1 Bluetooth receiver for $12 and connect then via the AUX and all devices connect fine.<br /><br />Please note:  The quality of the item is great and so its the sound.  The only annoying things are the Bluetooth issue (which I think its a hardware and software issue; and the strange voice when powering it on or pairing the device or connecting the AUX.  Otherwise, IMHO I think the device its good and hope that its mostly a lollipop compatibility issue that will be resolved in the near future by Google.",6/22/2015,1434947751,206.2.205.141

Still works fine.<br /><br />That makes this one true outdoor speaker. Big volume, good audio with bass response, and a great IPx6 rating, one step below being actually submersible. Has a couple unique aspects to the battery design:<br /><br />1) Point to clarify - the battery capacity is 7000mAh, but batteries have a general conversion percentage of 70%, meaning you get 70% of the juice back that you put in.  At 5200mAh, that is 74% conversion.  In other words, the battery capacity is 7000mAh as it would be labeled on anything else, just the manufacturer not only declares the realistic amount, but also has an above average efficiency.  Can also double as a external battery charger for mobile devices, and it's own output is rated at a whopping 2.6 amps. Tap the red button on the side to switch to Output, as well as lighting up the battery life meter.<br /><br />2) Instead of having two ports, one for In, and one for Out, it only has one USB Type A port - so yes, it charges via USB to USB (and not Micro or Mini). Has a super long included flat USB/USB cord along with a super long flat 3.5mm Aux cord.<br /><br />- Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes",6/21/2015,1434885624,200.84.3.250

The audio level and quality is excellent. The construction inside and out is not quite U.S. commercial grade, but it's much better than typical consumer grade, especially at this price point.  The cast aluminum body and silicon rubber seal in the MIC were pleasant surprises. The power cord is a minor exception, it could have slightly better wire and lighter plug. Rockbirds was prompt and professional when I submitted some questions, I just wish they also sold the cable so I wouldn't have to wait for shipping from China.<br /><br />I bought mine mostly for APRS packet and Radio Direction Finding using Doppler, so I was disappointed there was no External Speaker jack. The existing jack is just for programming per the Juentai web site.  After checking inside, I found simply adding a 1\\"" jumper could put Receive Audio on the MIC jack, and if you're willing to drill a hole (voiding warranty, I'm sure) you can easily add an External Speaker jack.  Watch out for the CALL button, you could easily end up transmitting when you don't expect/want to (not good for the Doppler).  I believe a menu setting can turn this feature off.<br /><br />If you want more info on the mods, search for my call sign at youtube or radioference dot com.<br />73, Gary N8RDF",6/21/2015,1434852026,210.213.165.241

I was initially VERY frustrated by the poor instructions included in the retail box... specifically, there is no information in the guide on how to charge the internal 4000mAh battery. The instructions need a total redo, and once we figured out how to use this device we liked it.<br /><br />Battery function<br /><br />After unpacking the device, find the supplied multi-cable kept in the area under the tray inside of the box. This cable has a standard male USB on one end that splits into two pigtail ends; one pigtail is a male micro-USB and the other a male 3.5mm AUX.<br /><br />Plug the standard USB end into your favorite charging device (wall charger, USB charging station, laptop USB port, etc...), we used our Samsung wall charger, and then pull the end-cap off of the battery/speaker unit to (1) turn the unit on and (2) access the unit's ports.<br /><br />Once the end-cap is pulled off, plug the cable's 3.5mm Aux pigtail end into the corresponding port on the battery. There seem to be two 3.5mm Aux ports on the end of the battery, but one is just a dummy and the other is real. The active one is not marked, but you will be able to tell when you pick the proper one as the device's LED light will light up and a voice may say 'Bluetooth' or 'Aux connect'... the voice seems to randomly say things from time-to-time. If you stick the 3.5mm Aux jack into the dummy hole, nothing happens at all.<br /><br />The unit has three small LED lights that inform you of the remaining charge in the battery; upon initial connection, one light was lit signifying that the unit may have been up to 33% precharged by the factory. Over the next six or seven hours, the battery progressed to full charge... which seems like a fairly long time give out 2.1A charger's output. Further reading indicated why; the input flow rate of this unit is just 0.8A max, regardless of the power source's capability. That's fairly slow and even at that rate we did feel a little heat built up near the connection end as charging was going on.<br /><br />Once charged, using the battery was not difficult; using either the supplied cable or the cable that come with your device (recommended), just connect your device to the battery's USB port and charge your device as needed. The storage capacity of this battery is 4000mAh which is good for a charge and another partial boost, but not for multiple charges without recharging.<br /><br />The charging times we experienced were about what we get from 1A wall chargers... on average, a rate of about 1/3 percent per minute, which equates to about 1% every 2.5 to three minutes or about 20% - 25% per hour. The batteries in our phones are 2200 mAh and 2400mAh in capacity, so this makes sense given the battery's 1A rated output.<br /><br />Speaker function<br /><br />For its size, the speaker actually punches out decent sounds; it is fairly convenient and portable at 4 7/8 inches long, 1.25 inches (roughly) in diameter and about 4.8 ounces per our postal scale. The backup battery & speaker combo unit is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.<br /><br />The specifications in the paltry user guide notes that the speaker was \\""ZW\\"" of power... assume they meant 2W, and it puts out good volume for the small size.<br /><br />You can crank it up fairly loud without significant distortion, and when laid flat on a solid foundation like a counter or table  top, it provides decent bass, and good mid and treble. There are no controls (volume, next track, skip, etc...) available on the unit itself, so all of the control must come from your sending device. Not a problem for us, and the speaker actually responded well to the equalizer application on my phone.<br /><br />You can send music to this device by Bluetooth or by direct wire view the 3.5mm port (same port you used to charge the battery...)<br /><br />Bluetooth<br /><br />Pulling the battery/speaker's end-cap off and then putting it back into place is what is needed in order to activate the speaker's Bluetooth search (blue LED light flashes). Pairing with my phone was quick and trouble-free, and we found the range to be good -- better than many other similar devices we have tested.<br /><br />Typically the phone paired with the speaker was within three to 12 feet of the speaker, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices. The BT sound production is not bad at all and, as mentioned, it responded nicely to my equalizer app.<br /><br />3.5mm Aux<br /><br />This unit's speaker also plays nicely through 3.5mm Aux connection, and it offers an interesting feature; the end-cap has two male 3.5mm Aux connectors built into it, and they can be used in this process. All you do is plug one in to the 3.5mm headphone port of your sending device (like my HTC Droid DNA) and the other into the active 3.5mm Aux port on the unit.<br /><br />The sound produced by the 3.5mm Aux cable connection is really not bad at all, and by situating the connection from the back-side of your sending device, the battery becomes a lengthwise stand.  This works very well, especially when we decided to watch a Netflix movie on my phone.<br /><br />The opportunity here is that not all transmission devices are configured in a way that the end-cap can be used to make the 3.5mm Aux connection... we have an older MP3 player that is just too thick. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a 3.5mm Aux cable with male jacks on both ends, but then we do have several of those already and they worked fine with this speaker too. The Amazon listing's \\""Package Contents\\"" section does not that the unit includes \\""1xThe 3.5 mm audio line\\"", but we did not receive a separate 3.5mm cable... just the portion attached to the single multi-cable included with the unit.<br /><br />Sorry about the length of this review... just turned out that way. Many ins & outs, pluses and minuses...<br /><br />No mention of a warranty that we could find, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this device gratis from the seller and have put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a combination 4000mAh power bank, 2W speaker & stand of this size, style, price and capacity, for use as I have described above, then we would recommend giving this unit a try based on our experience with it.

As far as it being too quiet, I think the trick is knowing how to turn the volume up, since it isn't obvious from just looking at the buttons.

Main complaint is really that when in Bluetooth mode, it's hard to tell what's going on when the + and - buttons are pressed -- a long press will adjust volume, while a short press will change tracks. However, this means it's hard to make small volume adjustments since you have to hold onto the button but there's no way to tell how much the volume has gone up, until it actually does (quite quickly).  The Chinese accented English announcing the different connection modes is ... amusing, but does not detract from overall functionality.  Edit: another mild complaint: if you're using the line-in mode and turn the power off and on, you have to unplug the audio cable and plug it in again for it to detect it.  Still not a deal breaker though, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the speaker.",6/19/2015,1434727541,196.63.212.87

In the end, it can be done, even assigning channel names manually, but it is cumbersome.<br />Computer programming can be done using ANY Serial (or USB serial emulation) to 3.5mm stereo pin cable. The programming SW does not accept copy and paste, and the radio is not CHIRP compatible, as of the date of my review. If you run Windows XP, you need to worry only with the normal Prolific driver limitations. If you run WIN 7, you will need to fix the MSCOMCTL.OCX driver. After that, the SW will work on Windows 7.<br />The main issues I have with the radio are listed below:<br /><br />1) Humming noise when volume is all the way down, even when using a signal clean battery as power source,<br />2) Loss of audio when the encoder is used to switch from/to an active channel<br />3) The loud beep sounds when the scan function finds an active channel (instead of playing the audio),<br />4) The RX interference it suffers when the vehicle is in motion and the radio is fed from the cigarette lighter cord that came with it.<br />5) The high cost to return it to China (around US$50), even if the unit is defective. Not Amazon nor the dealer seem to be willing to pick up the tab.<br /><br />Therefore, in a $99 radio I would need to spend about 50% of its value to return it. This situation basically forces me to keep the radio and use it with all limitations described, or as paper weight.<br /><br />I have seem other owners stating they do not hear the humming noise I described, and that is part of the &#34;hit or miss&#34; quality of my unit, but the main issues are firmware dependent. In a radio that has no capability to have its firmware upgraded, the only way to see a fix is to wait for 2 or 3 new firmware cycles and then purchase it at thattime. Your mileage may vary, but I am disappointed.",6/19/2015,1434710803,217.198.161.241

They were the best rod holders I ever saw, they were the bomb!!!!!.  I used on my previous boat, a close facsimiles to &#34;Fish On&#34; brand rod holders, that did not last, and eventually paying the extra money to have the Fish On brand on my 90' Sylvan.  They were great!  When I bought this boat in 2004, the boat dealer told me that these Ram Rod Holders were heads and shoulders above the others, and that the extra money was well spent...  It was!  The Ram Rod Holders were all that he said they were.  The versatility of these rod holders was far and away a complete departure from the norm.<br /><br />In May I purchased a new 2015 Lund Pro-V, and the boat dealer, did not know about this type of rod holder.  So I decided to purchase these and install them myself.<br /><br />What you see in this picture that shows the product, was what I had in my last boat.  All aluminum component, covered with a rubberized compound.  Durably built to last the life of the boat.  What they sent out to me was NOT WHAT&#34;S PICTURED HERE!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />What I got was plastic, and that this picture was supplied by the manufacturer for their product to the vendors (Amazon).<br /><br />Now I first had this sent to me by Cabelas in April, and I was furious that I got something that didn't look at all like the ad pic!  So I called Cabelas up and sent back these rod holders, and told them about the inaccuracy of the pic.  They refunded my money, and I saw the same pic on Amazon's ad, and thought this time I'd get the right rod holder...  I DIDN&#34;T!!!!!<br /><br />In the meantime, Cabelas investigation found for me that I was indeed correct, and that the rod holder I wanted was no longer available, yet this pic is still used!<br /><br />I have all Ram Mount equipment on my boat for my rod holders and my GPS/Depth Finders, too.  I'm a huge fan of their products.  However, this deceptive picture is causing me to re-think that Ram is all that I had known them to be...  I am furious that this pic still is used to describe this product visually.  YOU WILL NOT GET THIS ROD HOLDER. AS THEY NO LONGER MANUFACTURE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />When you have the best product on the market, and a picture is worth a thousand words, and these rod holders are not inexpensive, WHY WOULD YOU MISLEAD YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS?????!!!!!<br /><br />I'm in the process of attaching these rod holders to my Lund Sport Track, I had to have the bracket apparatus manufactured by a welding shop.  As the Sport Track system has no brackets that allow for top mount, only side mounts, and that defeats the whole purpose of having this versatile product...  So if your considering this product to be incorporated into a Sport Track System, you need to know this fact.  I had a piece of 1/8&#34; aluminum made into a 2 1/2&#34; by 2 1/2&#34; right angle, that will allow me to place the Ram Mount Ball on the top of the gunwale.  So be aware!<br /><br />In the end, the sad truth is that they are probably still the best product out there, and I have to learn to live with this fact.  With that said, I am entirely upset with Ram as they are misleading loyal patrons like myself,  with these knowingly false representations of their product.  I look forward to seeing their Patten run out and better customer oriented companies that see the wisdom to make these products as they were originally designed available to the public.<br /><br />I have no idea how this product will perform or last!

The S8 is quite a bit larger than the S4 but offers much better sound Quality and has the ability to play much louder. This speaker is easy to connect to using the Wi-Fi on your phone or tablet or any other device capable outputting Bluetooth. The speaker is Bluetooth version 4.0 but it is fully backwards compatible with earlier versions. Bluetooth range is stated at 33 foot and I found the speaker to work exceptionally well and it times have exceeded 33 foot and the speaker still played fine. This speaker also has a built-in microphone for hands-free functionality for making phone calls conference calls and such. It comes with a nice carrying pouch in the box which was a nice surprise because I didn't see it in the original Ad.<br /><br />I used a decibel meter on my phone to measure the sound level and it hovered at about 96 dB and the app stated that that was between the average food blender and subway system. If you've ever been around of food blender I can assure you this is quite loud.<br /><br />I found battery life to be quite long, But it is a little slow to recharge. You charge this with a micro USB cable which is the standard charging system on any Samsung phone and most Bluetooth appliances.

It's not a terrible speaker.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Decent look<br />-Gets really loud<br />-The voice of &#34;Mamma&#34; from the Ubisoft game series narrates the features on this device<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sound quality isn't great, yeah it gets loud, but there is an odd emptiness to the sound, can't explain it, it is far from bad. For me there is way too much bass and not enough treble. For the price it's very good.<br />-Build quality (I guess for the price is fine) isn't great and the back subwoofer is installed crookedly, doubt that messes with sound quality too much, but you get what you paid for. Also the rubber strap still had some excess material that didn't get sheared off, not terrible. It really isn't terrible.<br />- The rubber feet on uneven surface is ever so slightly wobbly. Also they don't really make contact with a flat surface since there is a weird bulge in between them where the speaker bumps out on the bottom. You can tell that it's a normal build thing for aesthetics.So the feet are kind of useless (even with the plastic removed), but they do feel grippy if they were to be functional.<br />-So pressing the &#34;+&#34; skips the song, but you have to hold down &#34;+&#34; to turn up the volume, kind of backwards thinking there.<br />-The NFC is really hit or miss, but it is definitely there, so there is that.<br /><br />Is this going to replace a more expensive speaker, no, but for the money, it's pretty good. Too much bass, but some people like that, my music is more treble than bass so I don't love that feature.",6/18/2015,1434635657,219.145.237.245

I love that when a speaker talks to me like that. Well after using this speaker for a while, it has decided to speak an Asian language. We all get a big kick out of it. We have no clue what it says, but it has a happy voice and talks really loud. My guess - it is saying Power On, Bluetooth ready to pair, and Bluetooth paired.<br /><br />Everybody can laugh at this because this speaker actually sounds great. The design is excellent - I've seen it with some other really good Bluetooth speakers. This is a two speaker sealed acoustic design with a passive bass speaker in the bottom. For a small speaker with a good amount of amplifier power - this is the best design possible. The two speakers are roughly 1 inch Mylar cones with long through and flexible surrounds.<br /><br />I liked the speakers a lot. The bass was solid, it plays to a good high volume, and the mid-range and highs are clear. No it isn't audiophile great, but you never expected that. At this price point, this is a really good speaker. My son is so critical of small speakers - he used this for an evening while playing Call of Duty and said, hey dad, those are good speakers. He's also a guitarist - so he kind of knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />The speaker is rugged. Super rugged. The case is covered in that soft satin rubbery material. The grill is metal with a pretty geometric pattern in it. Thank goodness there is a real live power switch - not one of those stupid multi-function buttons. The speaker charges via an included microUSB cable. You provide the AC adapter, computer port, or powerbank battery. There is a slot for a MicroSD card - enjoy using that. And there is an Aux cable input.<br /><br />The top controls are really sweet. When you get near them they light up blue - a really cool blue. The phone button is play, pause, and answer the phone. The two buttons that look like speakers are tricky to use - short press moves the track. Long press changes the volume. When you reach max volume the speaker plays a goofy tone. This takes some getting used to. The buttons are touch sensitive, so you don't have to press anything.<br /><br />If you don't mind being yelled at in an Asian language every time you turn this on, you will be rewarded with a really great sounding speaker.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.When you reach max volume the speaker plays a goofy tone.

During playback, I didn't experience any &#34;hiccups&#34; within the audio as it was streaming from my device to the speaker. Nor, did I experience any issues as it was streaming from my Micro SD Card. It impressed me and others greatly with its crisp audio, fantastic bass and clever treble.<br /><br />This speaker was stated to play up to about 7 hours and it did just that. I took this puppy every where that I travel if I didn't take any headphones along for the trip. It would be clipped to my bag as I longboarded Downtown, back home or simply throughout the city limits. Plus, I found that the best volume to play audio/music at is around 75% - 85%, so you won't experience any cringing of any sorts. There are other features built into this speaker, such as a built-in microphone for you to answer and make calls if you wish. Plus, a built-in FM radio with a LED display clock and support for Micro SD Cards and TF Cards.<br /><br />  &#62; Power On/Off Button<br />  &#62; Volume Up/Skip Forward Button<br />  &#62; Volume Down/Skip Back Button<br />  &#62; Bluetooth/Play/Pause Button<br />  &#62; Answer/Deny Call Button<br /><br />The Bad: I didn't really find any horrible things about the Mini Bluetooth Speaker, but there a few things to point out. There isn't an audio-in jack if you're searching for one and recommended volume is about 85%. Otherwise, it's a great accessory for the road!<br /><br />The Experience: Personally, it's one of my favorite bluetooth speakers that I have reviewed this year so far. The fact that it's small, durable, crisp and bass-heavy (vis device settings) has made earned a THUMBS UP from me. If you're interested in an audio test, please do tell us (via comments) and we will publish one for you in no time.ng for one and recommended volume is about 85%.

I liked the specs and it was on sale at the time so I decided to purchase it despite my misapprehensions. I am a prime member so I got it delivered in 2 days. Packaging was really good; speaker came in a plastic casing which was secured in plastic wrapping and was placed in a neat box with bubble wrap. Was easy enough to open and came undamaged. Speaker is easy to pair with a Bluetooth device; didn't need to look at the instructions. It had some life in it so didn't charge before use. It came with the USB cord to charge, a cord that can be used to connect in a speaker port (like where the headset part of your phone is) and a little green clip. Tested quality with Bruno Mars' &#34;Uptown Funk&#34; and the output was quite satisfactory. Good bass. Only thing that can be termed a negative is that the bass causes the speaker to slide across surface like tables. If its on some form of fabric its fine, no shifting. Being on fabric doesn't muffle the sound in any way. The sound is quite powerful in a large room once there are no other devices competing. Its plays clear for Sam Smith songs as well. I had my cousin call my phone while it was connected to the speaker playing a song. The music was interrupted to ring for the phone. I answered the call with the little call button on the speaker. There is a like a fraction of a second delay between speech from the caller and what is heard through the speaker. This isn't a flaw in my opinion. When the caller comes close to the speaker a high-pitched feedback is heard by the caller. Again not a flaw in my opinion, why would someone who's calling you be right next to you!

The function buttons on top are very large and would be great for even an older person who has trouble seeing smaller buttons. The buttons are smooth on the top of the speaker so you don't have to worry about breaking any thing on it. On the back you will find both the auxiliary port, charger cord port, and on/off switch. To charge the speaker you simply attach the supplied cord to your USB port on your computer. It takes a couple of hours to fully charge but then runs for about eight hours on one charge which is pretty impressive. To pair it to your device, just turn the switch on the speaker to on and go to your bluetooth settings on your device and select the speaker.

I'm bummed to leave a negative review, because I was really stoked with it for that first week! I used it to port sound to the stereo of an older collectors car with an original stereo that I didn't want to rip out or modify. When it worked the sound was clear and it was easy to use. I liked that the head came off for security when you weren't there.  However, after the first week it started acting up. It would turn on for 20 seconds and then die for 5 minutes, then again on for 20 seconds and then die. I'm not sure if it was a loose connection at the magnetic base, or faulty wiring, but regardless of the cuase, mine has become un-usable.  It hurts that much more because of how much I loved it when it worked. Was such a slick way to port surf tunes to my '72 collector car!

I have literally worn most of them out, and they last when cared for! I use my GF a LOT. They are great when making a meal in the summer. It doesn't noticeably heat the room like the broiler in my oven and I think it uses much less power all year round. They are just the right size for one or two people.<br /><br />I cooked steak, lamb, pork, chicken, salmon, tuna, cod, haddock, bluefish, trout, and a bunch of stuff that just isn't coming immediately to mind. It was all great. The biggest danger is over-cooking because it's so fast and cooks from both sides at once.<br /><br />When cooking for one and there is space behind a steak or pork chop, I put slices of veggies like bell pepper and onions back there to cook with the steak. Behind the steak is a steamy spot on the grill and these veggies cook to perfection in the same time as the steak. Sometimes I rub them with olive oil for a nice taste.<br /><br />The tilted design is great to get rid of grease and the hot plates sear the surface to seal in juices and flavor. With fish I like to use a very light coating of Mayo which seems to help make pink and white fish even more detectibly moist and tasty. With steak and meats the grill works great with rubs and spices. I really like the Paul Prudome &#34;magic&#34; line of spices. Yum! Even cooking a whole trout is great, albeit I needed to slice it in two at the ribs so it all fit at once. About 6 minutes between the plates and done to yummy perfection.<br /><br />If you freeze steaks, a 6 oz 3/4&#34; thick steak frozen solid and dropped on the hot places will be done to medium in just about 10 minutes, in my experience steak cold out of the fridge of the same size/thickness is done to medium in about 5 to 6 minutes. The timing is just about second nature now.<br /><br />The non-stick surface isn't perfect, though pretty good. Be careful with forks/knives and use a plastic spatula to remove fish as it has a greater tendency to stick than anything else.<br /><br />Cleanup is oh so easy. While one must not put their little GF in the dishwasher or immerse it (I wish the plates were removable!) it's still pretty easy to clean.<br /><br />First, just after the food comes off I give it a quick hot wipe with a paper towel to get the bulk off. Just takes a second to do this. After the meal I finish the clean-up by hanging the front of the GF over the sink and using a soapy wet sponge. I thoroughly wash the plates and clean the catch tray. Then I use the clean catch tray to rinse the plates of soap, then drain it and both air dry. Water all flows into the sink and it's really clean. It all takes a minute or two.<br /><br />This is a great tool. If it wasn't so great why would I keep buying them? :-) I even keep a spare on the shelf in case my current 4 year old one fails. I love my GF and its saved so much of my time while giving me great food to enjoy. Fabulous!s a greater tendency to stick than anything else.<br /><br />Cleanup is oh so easy.

Additionally I have issues now when trying to protect (lock) a video recording (when pushing the down arrow,) camera then the shows an error, then freezes and turns off when connected to the car power.  Memory card is brand new class 10, and this same problem persists now matter what sd card is used.  Avoid and get newer technology.   If you are in the market for a 0801 dash cam be sure to get a branded one such as the E-PRANCE and not a generic/no brand 0801 camera for several reasons:  First, the generic/no brand 0801s firmware in my experience did not have a mph option and if you think you can just upgrade the firmware to fix this, good luck finding a compatible upgradeable firmware for a generic unit.  The wrong firmware could render the unit dead and from what I briefly read requires you to create a custom usb cable to flash it back from the dead.  Secondly, the generic no brand 0801s have a different plastic male mounting pedestal thickness on the camera vs the branded Eprance/Ojocam 0801s so you can't use a generic 0801 camera on the ojocam/eprance bases (gps or no gps doesnt matter).  The E-prance and Ojo 0801 cameras are interchangeable with their respective bases with gps working on either camera from either model base.  The difference since I have both the ojocam and the E-prance is that the E-prance mounting base is tighter fitting with no rocking of the camera once inserted which is a huge improvement over the ojocam 0801 I also have.  The only other difference I found is the ojocam firmware was customized with their splash screens for their company.  The menu fonts are the same and menu options I have found so far look to be the same.  The E-prance unit I ordered had the latest firmware from April 2015 from E-prance so you know you are getting the most up to date interfaceand options.  Audio recording could be better but all these 0801 units have this weak point.  The audio quality can sound pretty rough if you have the radio volume turned up.  The Video quality is great and span of view is wider than you may think, it covers almost a 180degree view from left to right.  Additionally, you can set it to record automatically upon start up and shuts down with no user intervention.  The user interface on all these units is a little tricky at first but read the manual and you will get the hang of it.  Unit can get warm/hot if in the sun and while running but has never shut down on me. Using a 16 gig Class 6 Samsung micro sd card with no issues.  These e-prance units are at a good price point at $77 with prime shipping, recommended.",6/17/2015,1434540388,195.239.186.87

No whine or static in any channels. Have it powering Rockford Fosgate Punch 6.5 components in the front and Polk (can't remember, just random  Polks (50RMS handling) as placeholders until I upgrade to Hertz) and they sound crystal clear/ more powerful than my Polk 660.4(75RMSx4) that just died on me a few days ago (which is more expensive and puts out less power). This being my first class D speaker amplifier, I cannot tell the difference between the class AB and D myths as the Polk was AB, maybe it's just a better quality amp or what but this sounds much better than the Polk as well as my Alpine M300 in my other car ( but the alpine does only put out 50 RMSx4). Much easier to dial it in gain wise to match my head units 5 volt pre-amp voltage (Pioneer 80PRS head unit) than the Polk as well. Amps I've looked at in comparison  were Soundstream Picasso series, Soundstream Tarantula, a few MB Quartz, Rockford Fosgate Prime 600d, Punch/Power series. All in all, I'm glad I went with this amp but I'm hoping I don't end up having the one channel dying on me issue that some have had.<br /><br />***Update as of 04/23/16***<br /><br />As of this date, for the past 2/3 months my front left channel has been cutting out, as I drive and make turns the speaker and tweeter will cut out continuously. Took apart my door and tweeter and all connections are sound. Unfortunately I'm going to bite the bullet and just buy a $300+ amp that puts out 100rms/speaker because it's frustrating having everything give out after so long with no abuse.",6/17/2015,1434557765,203.109.145.90

Also was able to forward to the next song and replay the previous song with the BT Speaker controls. The directions were in English but in a tiny font.

As a dash cam and DVR, it's a excellent piece of equipment with a very good wide angle camera and microphone, and it has several potentially very useful auxiliary features. Setup was relatively easy, and the user guide was better written than most of the ones that I've seen for dash cams.<br /><br />The camera has a lot of settings to customize its operation, but except for the date and time, you could use the default settings right out of the box. For testing purposes, to keep the file sizes down, I set the resolution at 1280x720/30fps (the highest resolution is 2304x1296/30fps, and there is an available 1920x1080/60fps), with image quality set to \\""Fine.\\"" Before using the dash cam for the first time, I inserted the included 16 GB Class 6 micro-SDHC card for recording. Make sure the device is connected to the vehicle's power outlet before recording begins, since the dash cam's built-in battery has a very limited capacity.<br /><br />One of the menu settings is \\""Beep.\\"" I recommend that you turn this off first, since it's annoying to hear the beep every time you choose a menu item. The settings include some specialized features like motion detection, parking monitor, G-sensor, and LDWS/FCWS (Lane Departure Warning System/Frontal Collision Warning System). I did try the LDWS, although I didn't try tweaking it very much. With the default setting, it worked, but not consistently, and the beeping got to be annoying when I was changing lanes intentionally. Frankly, I don't think the LDWS/FCWS features are going to work very well in a system where an add-on dash cam is the only sensor. In vehicles that have LDWS and FCWS capabilities built-in, I believe the systems are more sophisticated than just a single camera. It's not a failing of this dash cam, since I've found the same clunkiness in other dash cams that I've used.<br /><br />The dash cam also features an HDMI port with an included HDMI cable for viewing the video files on a TV or monitor that's equipped with an HDMI port. Note that if you do this, you'll need to power the dash cam from a USB port, since the device's own small battery will only power it for a few minutes.<br /><br />If the G-sensor feature is turned on in the settings, the sensor determines if the car has crashed, in which case the last file is locked so it can't be erased by loop recording. Needless to say, I'm not planning to test this feature.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very capable dash cam/DVR that will give you an excellent HD video record of your driving.<br /><br />The dash cam was provided to me for evaluation.

Make sure you get a good adapter with a fuse and you probably want to avoid the cheap ones from the local auto parts store.  Also, I soldered this adapter on and used heat shrink tubing to avoid getting a short or broken wire down the road.  I would have much preferred paying an additional 3 dollars to have this already attached.  Anyone who wanted to do a permanent install could just cut off the adapter.<br /><br />Once installed, it works pretty good, but about every 10th time or so I hook my iPhone 5S up to it the audio doesn't work right and just makes a very loud &#34;digital static&#34; noise and I have to unplug the phone and replug it back in.<br /><br />In my opinion, the audio actually sounds better through this than out mini-jack on the iPhone.

I pulled the center dash panel (good instructions can be found all over the forum), and popped the radio first to check all the connections. After disconnecting and cleaning all the connections I found that the performance was the same - local stations were not receiving in stereo, distant stations were buried in static, and seek didn't find much - even among my presets. With some consideration - I tried isolating the radio, by grounding it with a harness directly to a frame connection in the forward cabin firewall - but this didn't have much (if any effect).  I decided to try removing and cleaning the antenna. Along the way I traced the wire and verified no critters had been snacking on it and that it was making a good connection throughout - well, I lost the chase as it passed through the firewall, but it was good that far, and I took the rest on faith. I removed, cleaned, lightly sanded the rod, brushed the connector points with a stainless brush, added a little conductive sealant on top of the connector, threadlocked the threads and yanked it tight. All great for practice, but it didn't help - AT ALL. No change. At this point, I was pretty sure I had a dud radio - but I thought I'd take the opportunity to tinker. I noticed (according to my JK's compass) that when running N/S routes reception was better than on E/W routes - so I figured it should have something to do with the antenna position or cable path, causing a blind spot during E/W-W/E travel. It wasn't a BIG difference, but it was a needling concern over 10 years of ownership. I decided that a good course could be to replace the antenna AND cable with a new setup - to see if that helped at all. I ordered this one: Antenna and I also got a rubber ducky to replace the whip outside. I first installed the whip, knowing that it wouldn't help (but at the same time knowing I've never trusted a stainless whip as an antenna anyway). It didn't help. Nor did installing the new antenna and cable!!! Well, not until I monkeyed with the installation some (more than some, but not a lot). with the dash still open, I tried a couple a placements for the antenna - along the rollcage horizontal top supports. down the passenger and the driver side was less than stellar performance, and the cable isn't long enough to reach the center of my unlimited rig. i ended up with the best performance when I put the antenna over the dash inside the plastic cowling along the top of the windshield. I directed the cable through the cowling over the passenger sun visor - and down the inner cowling of the windshield vertical support. From there I entered the dash and used zip ties to route it over the glove compartment and keep it tucked away - then into the center dash compartment from behind the dash. By manipulating it an playing with the routing, I found that crossing the glove compartment straight across, then turning the cable at a 90 degree angle to the front of the compartment, and around the radio installation support frame, behind the radio compartment and into the back of the radio. If you're not careful about that cable path it may cause some issues. I found that it's also important to get the cable connector on the antenna cable clear of the other wires and harnesses in the compartment as well - move the connector up behind the radio in the front portion of the dash for the best performance. Now the Radio works great - I get all the local stations in full stereo, many distant stations, and even catch some dx when the weather is right. I still notice some deleterious effects when the weather is heavy in my area, but we are mountainous - so it's not unexpected. Overall, I would gauge this as at least a 500% improvement in reception. That's estimated, not based on empirical analysis. I STRONGLY recommend this configuration and the products I have mentioned. I hope you have as much good luck as I did -and enjoy the ride!! (I enjoy it a little more with some great tunes to blare when it's time to go topless!!)",6/15/2015,1434388225,201.25.40.188

It actually works - Until you go mobile,"Update - I tried to use this in my car and had nothing but trouble. Audio gets so choppy it's unreadable. Seller is great though! He tried to make it work and eventually refunded my purchase. This radio is a great design with too many bugs right now. Work the bugs out and 5 stars it will be!  First off, if you have ever programmed a Chinese radio, this is exactly the same. It works as it should. 25 watts VHF is spot on and 20 watts UHV is close enough. I like that you can program the memory channel name through the menu. For those having trouble with programming the offset, it is actually pretty easy - first select the receive frequency and save it to a memory channel. Then switch back to VFO mode and select the transmit frequency and tone if needed and then save it to the same memory channel. Most Chinese radio program offsets this way and while it is a pain in the a$$ it does work. You can then switch to channel mode and enter the alpha name if you want. It is definitely easier to program using the cable and chirp but it can be done with the menus if you have the time. 5 stars simply because the bang for the buck is there. You will not find a dual band radio in in this price range that does 25 watts and actually works. I have worked several nets and had very good audio reports. I can hit repeaters 40 miles away using my Workman UVS-200 antenna mounted 25' on my roof. Not bad for less than 1/4 the cost of some other dual banders. It does not do cross band repeat.",6/14/2015,1434297346,197.112.106.229

Input: 3.5V to 30V. Output: 4.0V to 30V.<br /><br />I want to thank all who contributed their insights on the DC/DC Boost Converter with LM2587S Regulator. Since the converters did not have their own instructions, the experiences of others were very valuable to me. So, I decided to do my own tests for a future thermoelectric generator application. Given my abbreviated verification testing was rudimentary at best; the results showed the converters work.<br /><br />Note. The LM2587 is rated for 5A, but that's a maximum rating for a particular application. Other components in this converter impose limits: the SS34 diode has a 3A rating and 40V [repetitive] peak inverse voltage max. The capacitors are limited to 35V max. Please keep these limits in mind.<br /><br />So, the purpose of this exercise was to test and compile instructions for the DC/DC boost converter. Test instrumentation and other equipment included a regulated DC power supply, a fuse assembly, digital multimeter and the requisite test leads.<br /><br />The procedures included first placing a 2 ampere (A) fuse in series with the negative input lead from a regulated DC power supply and setting its potential to 5-volts (V). Initially, I tried to adjust the converter while connected to a 100 load resistor as others suggested. This closed circuit method did not work for me. Thus, all adjustments were done “open circuit”.<br /><br />I then turned the converter’s potentiometer (blue trim pot) counterclockwise (CCW) with it connected to the 5V supply and adjusted the converter’s output to 18V.<br /><br />The 18V output remained stable even with a 3V input potential. With a 3V input, the converter’s input current fluctuated from 0.01 to 0.02A, but the 18V output was essentially stable. Increasing the input to 4V stabilized the current at 0.01A. So, I set each converter for an 18VDC output given a 4VDC input.<br /><br />I also checked each converter’s output before making any adjustments. In each case, the “factory default” converter output ranged from 20 to 22VDC. I could not verify the “3x rule” whereby the output should not exceed the input by a 3:1 ratio.<br /><br />I reviewed the LM2587 specification sheet and applications notes; available from Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor websites. The LM2587 “Simple Switcher® 5A Flyback Regulator” is the only active component - the converter’s overall function relies on it. The spec sheets do not cite a “3x rule”.<br /><br />Per the specification sheet, when used as a boost (step-up) switching regulator, the LM2587 produces an output voltage greater than the input supply voltage; it does not mention a specific ratio. Though this particular converter design could have this limitation.<br /><br />T. RANEY...bald engineer guy with glasses",6/14/2015,1434278523,202.145.83.235

We have had this particular smart watch for several week now, really trying to get to know it well. I am not a wristwatch wearer, never have been, so I enlisted our 16 year old son in the testing and review of its functionality.<br /><br />His finding are that this smart watch is very basic as compared to others he tried. He had no trouble syncing it with his Samsung Galaxy S3 and setting time, date and alarm. He had no trouble getting notification that calls were coming in, but that is about it. The volume that the speaker on this watch produces, and maybe the quality of the speaker used, makes it very difficult to hear and understand what the caller is saying. Therefore, instead of being able to keep the phone in his pocket and use the watch to communicate, he had to dig the phone out and use it.<br /><br />As a watch, this unit works fine though it is a bit larger than the watch he typically wears. As a device to improve the efficiency of his electronic communications, or to play music transmitted from his phone, other smart phones in the same price range had better performance.<br /><br />Sample provided for testing and review",6/13/2015,1434159295,210.151.184.247

They work but they aren’t particularly good. Further, they usually have just one USB port and take up an A/C power outlet. This 2-port USB charger by AGPtek goes beyond those basic chargers in a couple of very good ways.<br /><br />This is a two-port USB charger that provides 2.4A through both ports. For devices that can take a high-speed charge this is a huge upgrade from most manufacturer-supplies chargers. Unlike a lot of other third-party chargers, this one delivers the higher amperage on both ports – most offer 1A on at least one port. So, this charger can deliver a fast charge on two devices at one time.<br /><br />This charger has foldable prongs so it packs into a nice little block for travel. The hinge for the prongs is tight and there is no side-to-side wiggle at all which is a good indicator that it is made well. The whole assembly is solid, has some heft to it and feels well-made.<br /><br />In testing this block has worked well with my phone and my tablet. I have seen no issues and it charged both devices quickly. That’s really all I could ask.<br /><br />I like this charger and will be taking it with me when I travel. It is well made and it delivers a fast charge. The fact that it is inexpensive is just a bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

Here are the pros:<br /><br />1. The charging stands work well, the radios are held firmly in place. When the radio isn't in the charger, you can place a spare battery in it and it will hold it in place. The LED is red until it is charged, then turns green.<br /><br />2. The belt clip is screwed into place using 2 small machine screws that go into 2 metal anchors on the back of the radio, NOT into the plastic. If the clip; should break, it can be replaced (not sure where to get spares at this point)<br />  UPDATE - THE CLIPS ARE AVAILABLE ON AMAZON<br /><br />3. The antenna also screws on (makes replacement and storage easier).<br />  UPDATE - THE ANTENNAS ARE AVAILABLE ON AMAZON<br /><br />4. VOICE PROMPTS - The radios use voice prompts, when you first turn it on, it announces that power is on, then it tells you the channel it is presently set to. If you change the channel, it will announce the channel number you switched to.  Very clever way to track channel settings. If you accidentally change the channel, you will hear the radio announce the channel you inadvertently switched to.<br /><br />5. RANGE - We want to utilize these when shopping, and occasionally from car to car on a trip. We tested these in our development and it got a bit of static at about 3/4 miles and only cut out when I was in a valley with trees and many houses between us. Despite the hilly terrain with houses and trees, the range was good up to 3/4 miles. For our purpose this was absolutely acceptable.<br /><br />Please note, the range was tested with batteries NOT at full charge.<br /><br />CONS - At this point, I can only say I am uncertain as to how they will hold up and last.<br /><br />I purchased a set of 5 spare batteries so that will help for long trips or usage periods. I, in fact, just ordered a second pair of these radios just before writing this review. I DEFINITELY think they are worth the present price of $27 a pair.<br /><br />UPDATE - 06/12/15  Second pair received and one of the radios had the sequencing of the first 5 channels all jumbled. They went 10,15,16, 9,10 and then 6 THRU 16, so channels 1-5 were missing and replaced with 10,15,16, 9 and 10. Returning them and re-ordered another pair.<br /><br />UPDATE - 06/18/15 The third pair (to replace the defective second pair) arrived and checked out good. No apparent problems.<br />The pair we had originally ordered worked very well while we were out shopping at Walmart. No problems.of the radios had the sequencing of the first 5 channels all jumbled.

I have OLD cars. 1994 Ford Explorer for one. Old school cassette player so I just used one of those adapters that plugs into the headphone jack on your phone/whatever. Problem was, if you didn't fiddle around with the volumes on them, they would sound oh so terrible! AND you were limited by that cord running between your phone and the cassette player.<br />PROs:<br />I live in the sticks. I mean remote. If you get 5 miles away from the biggest town, you've got no reception. Even satellite is hindered here because of steep mountainous terrain. So no radio. Pick one of the frequencies on this thing. Any of them. They all work.<br />No more cords dangling around just waiting to get snagged by the driver...  You get the picture.<br />Plenty of ways to listen to music. If you can't get your phone to Bluetooth, or if you have a device that can't Bluetooth, then load a micro SD with WMA or mP3 songs.<br />You can charge your phone using the USB port, so you don't lose the use of the lighter &#34;port&#34; for charging.<br />You can use either your phone or the Jebsen to control music functions. You can skip ahead using the buttons on the adapter, as well as control the volume by turning the knob. Plus, using the Jebsen to skip tracks makes more safety sense since you shouldn't be messing with your phone while driving anyway. If they see you using a phone while driving around here, expect to get a ticket.<br />Small enough to throw in the glove box, jockey box, or whatever you call them these days.<br />Once paired, the unit quickly connects to your phone. Like it's sitting there waiting to connect...<br /><br />CONs:<br />Maybe it was just me, but I had a hard time getting my phone (LG Lucky) to pair. the instructions didn't give me much help either. I'm not even sure what I did to get it to pair, but finally it paired.<br />A little too big for my Ford. This fits great in my 1997 Saturn SW2. But if you are familiar with or own an old Explorer, you know how much room you get to jockey stuff around.  If you get it at just the right angle you can slide it all the way in so it makes a connection. Otherwise, you can't get the power. Not that this is a problem with the device, just my vehicle.

I think it's a design flaw rather than faulty parts or user error and here's why... The bluetooth only seems to cut out when streaming decent audio quality. My guess is the bluetooth radio in this unit can't handle even average audio bandwith. Trying to play a 320kbps mp3 is a joke. I get about two seconds of sound and ten seconds of nothing before the sound comes back.

Well, if you have an audio source which allows for 3.5mm connection then you can plug this little device in and transmit that audio via bluetooth. Let me give you a couple scenarios. In my car, I do not have bluetooth by default, but have wired up an Aux in on my deck. So, I just plug this little guy in, sync it up to my phone and I now have a way to transmit my phone's audio onto my car stereo! I can take calls hands-free and listen to my music collection without wearing earphones. How about if you are at home listening to a stereo system, but need to be quiet due to sleeping kids? Well, if your stereo has Aux ports then you can plug this in and have up to two sets of headphones get the audio from your stereo unit.<br /><br />In the package you get the unit itself, a small 3.5mm male-to-male cable and a micro USB charging cable. The instructions state that you can get up to 10 hours of use out of one charge and that was my experience with this device.<br /><br />Overall I would say if you are wanting to transmit audio over bluetooth and have an Aux port then check this item out!",06-09-2015,1433817194,193.11.190.106

After researching modestly priced options I ordered the DragonFly 4 Pro with Navionics Gold bundle.  After using it for only a short time I must say I am VERY IMPRESSED at the features you get for the price. It's not quite as fast as higher end units (for example, it takes a little more time for some of the automatic features to switch things like depth range) and I haven't seen any 'photo-like' downscan images (yet).  However, the unit performs very well and the quality of the sonar alone (CHIRP--what other unit in this price range has that?) makes this a worthy consideration.  The wi-fi connects easily to your smart phone and the Wi-Fish app works really well.  Using it with an iPad gives a screen nearly the size of my HDS-10.  Remember that it is 2-channel and that the unit must be running the same channels as your smart phone or iPad or you will have a frozen screen when using dual displays or when trying to view a display that is not active on the unit. The screen is smaller than I thought but the image quaility makes it surprisingly easy to interpret.  I might add an update later if disappointed with any features or it turns out not to be durable but it really 'works as advertised'.<br /><br />I had a couple comments on the Amazon description and one review that I have seen.  Regarding Amazon's listing, it says things like &#34;none&#34; for things like waypoints/routes and RMS max.  I suspect they meant to say that they did not have the final specs at the time of listing the item.  I think it has capability for something like 2500 waypoints and many routes and sufficient RMS to view depths down to something like 600 feet.  If you are fishing fresh water you should not worry about the unit being under-powered.<br /><br />One reviewer said that the Navionics chip that comes with the unit is not updatable (for 1 year) like current Navionics Gold chips that are adding user data to keep charts current.  I checked into that and Navionics does say this about bundled Gold cards.  Having said that, when I went to their site to register the card it asked if I wanted to update my card and the process proceeded through completion.  Maybe Navionics has seen the value of people adding their user data to keep Gold Charts current and have waived the limitation.  I say that because the Navionics iPhone app currently costs $9.99 (or at least did a couple days ago) and is advertised for $49.99 so they seem to be accomodating customers for some reason.",06-08-2015,1433726363,222.28.8.178

The one thing that really concerns me, however, is something I noticed yesterday: The on/off slider on the back of the speaker is starting to recede, which means it's very hard to reach it to slide it on or off. It's disappointing to see that happening after the modest use it's had, and I guess I have to decide pretty quickly whether I'm going to return it or not (before my return window closes). I'll use it for the next day or two to decide. If it gets to the point where I can't turn it on or off anymore, I guess that'll be the deal-breaker. I've enjoyed the convenience, but I'm not going to keep it if that switch becomes non-functional.  Updated on 6/10/2015:  I reluctantly decided to return this speaker because I was no longer able to slide the on/off switch at all—I would have had to get a paperclip or something like that. It's a shame, because it was a handy little speaker to have around, and I'll miss it. But there's no point in having a $32 paperweight gathering dust, so I decided to return it to Amazon while I still could.",06-08-2015,1433706955,214.59.56.215

Couple this with my personal hatred for radio, and I've struggled to figure out a way to listen to my music (or podcasts) on long commutes - that is until now.  Once exhausting all of the options listed above, I began to think of other ways to play my phone's audio in the car. My first thought was to just use the phone itself, it does have built-in speakers after all. After one drive it seemed like a less than optimal solution, and after one drive with the windows open I realized it wasn't going to work at all. Then I looked into changing my car's radio, or another part of my car, to be able to connect my phone. After looking up the process involved in doing so, as well as the price, I realized that too wasn't going to work.  Then one day I discovered FM transmitters. I wasn't sure how I had gone so long without hearing about them, but it seemed like the perfect solution; cheap, easy, and playable directly through my car's radio. I bought one for ~$5 and was very disappointed when I received it. It had a short battery life, almost always needed to be recharged, wouldn't stay connected to my phone, and probably most importantly, I was able to hear the static more than the music.  I realized that you usually get what you pay for, and decided to try my luck with a more upscale charger. After a ~$25 investment, I was excited to finally be able to listen to my music. This transmitter stayed in my phone, and held a great charge, but unfortunately the static was still pretty intense.  I had given up and begun looking for yet another way to reconfigure my car, when I was offered a T9 FM transmitter for review. It was my first time trying a transmitter that used bluetooth, so I was hoping maybe that would remedy the static problems, and to my surprise, it actually did.This transmitter doesn't need to be charged because it remains plugged into your car, and has a USB port in it so you can still charge a device. The thing that makes this transmitter different, is that with other transmitters when you turn the radio volume up enough to actually hear the audio, you start to notice the static. The T9, however, has a volume adjuster on its own, so if you raise your phone to full volume then adjust it from the transmitter, the static becomes much less of a problem.  That's not to say the static isn't a problem at all, because it still can be, but if you adjust the volume correctly and find the best radio station to use it with (it comes with 6 preset) it's a huge improvement. The only place I haven't noticed an improvement is in residential neighborhoods and more densely populated areas. In other words, the more urban you get, the less useful it becomes. Still, overall I would definitely recommend it. It's the best FM transmitter I've used so far.  This was sent to me for free in return for an unbiased review.",06-08-2015,1433783263,217.47.68.86

I should have expected that. While transmitting using DTMF commands the tones comes out of the AF output at max volume (no matter where the volume knob is set). It is so loud that the AF mutes itself until the radio is powered off and then back on. Same thing happens with the heat warning beeping at max volume, which seems to happen in every conversation. I discovered this problem while wearing an earphone which made it especially annoying but it does the same thing on speaker too. The radio is a copy of an Yaesu FT 8900 which is probably the first problem. It's not really a &#34;quad bander&#34; since only two bands can operate at one time. It's a duel band radio with 4 selectable bands. You can monitor the same band on both sides and you can program it (with some difficulty) without the software which are the only reasons I give it 2 stars instead of 1.

If I paid $750 for Bose or some other upscale product, there is no way that it could be ten times as good as the SC-807.  There is nothing that could be even twice as good.  I gave it 4 stars mainly because the volume and tuning controls are really stupid.  I had to loop a rubber band around the perimeter of the volume control in order to turn it, and it isn't the old spiral wire control that increases the volume as you turn the knob, you have to rock it to the right once for each increment of increase.  It also doesn't increase the volume enough, probably because the speaker couldn't handle it.  Some other annoying things are that the digital display alternates between the time and function.  The time apparently reverts to 12:00 every time you turn it off, and if you are listening to a cassette tape, it reads, tAPE, which looks like either EAPE or just APE.  I love that I can play tapes, cd's and thumb drive, as well as some things I haven't tried yet.  I like that the cassette controls have a plastic hinged cover.

Let me try to help with that - this is not a super-high-quality piece of hardware.  The plastic pieces seem kind of cheap, and the ear buds aren't very nice.  However, the aluminum case is actually pretty decent, the Micro SD card seems about as well made as others that I've bought, and the mini USB cable (yes, it charges with mini USB versus the more prevalent micro USB) is surprisingly nice.

If you do buy one, look at the various colors and 16GB vs 8GB offerings to see what your best pricing option is that day - they fluctuate.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I too owned the iPod nano this is so clearly meant to replicate. I was offered a free sample for evaluation, and I was excited to get it. I've spent many weeks trying to decide if I should evaluate it, but I've been pushed to do so by Charles Spanky's brave 1-star review (on the green 16GB version) as well as my brother's much higher four-star rating (likewise, for that color). Plus... I'm just tired of the need to review it hanging over my head.<br /><br />So... why two stars instead of the one that Charles gave?<br /><br />Because this item does have some nice aspects to it. You get a 16GB micro SD card, a mini USB cable (useful for 15 year old devices you find in drawers, perhaps), earbuds (low quality, but serviceable), and a fun little puzzle (&#34;how to I get this darned thing to work?&#34;). You also get a surprisingly decent audio recorder and an FM radio that actually sounds fantastic with better headphones plugged in. Music sounds really good as well. I mean, truly, genuinely good. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />So, why two stars instead of the four my brother gave?<br /><br />Because I fear that rating it higher would kill the little that remains of my soul. This just isn't, in my opinion, a four star device, even at $25. Maybe it's worth half that... maybe it's a four-star $12.50 device, because then you could part it out upon its death and recoup your expenses. Maybe.<br /><br />But... look, I love tech. I love love love love tech. I have more phones than fingers. I get giddy around anything mechanical or that consumes (or generates) power. I'm excited by this sort of stuff usually, even the low-end things. But I just cannot stand this one. The button-circle-control thingy is *horribly* inaccurate/laggy/inconsistent. The movie player only plays movie formats that no one living has except maybe on a PC from 1994 somewhere in their basement. Ebooks? Um, no. Even if you could manage to get one on-screen, the control pad would make reading it unbearable. Music plays great... but the 1999 folder scheme has been out of date since the first iPod and is - again - near useless when using the control pad to navigate it.<br /><br />Worst of all: the thing died on me. I let it run out of charge, and now it cannot be used when not plugged in. It simply will not hold a charge for even a second's worth of playing - it's like there is no battery at all. I've tried charging at 500mA, at 1A, and at 2A. Nothing. So, as little as this was worth as a $25 device, it's worth less as a $25-plus-external-battery device.<br /><br />If it played movies in formats known to modern humans, I'd rate it higher. If the directory structure made finding music easier, I'd rate it higher. If the control pad worked well, or if it used micro USB, or if it didn't die after going uncharged for a few days, or if it came with a 64GB micro SD card, I'd rate it higher. As it is, I just can't.<br /><br />You want something better? New prepaid cellphones are often near this price and will perform so much better. Not long ago, the nice-for-the-price now-discontinued [[ASIN:B00E45043A Nokia 520]] was $20. The fantastic [[ASIN:B00HPP3QD6 Moto G]] has been as low as $25. I own both of these, and they ABSOLUTELY BLOW THIS OUT OF THE WATER and can do everything this can (except the Moto G doesn't use a micro SD card).<br /><br />Look around at prepaid cellphones. They are cheap, and many will do everything this does and more. Buy one of them instead...<br /><br />...unless you like much frustration and occasional intermittent joy. If that's you, buy this. The form factor also works for spreading garlic butter on bread, so there's that.butter on bread, so there's that.",06-07-2015,1433621955,216.198.232.197

I've copied my review from another listing below.)<br /><br />Nowadays, USB chargers come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, number of ports, and current capabilities. Some have external cords, and others (like this charger) plug directly into an outlet. If you're looking for a USB charger, you've got a lot of choices. :) Only you know the best set of specs for your needs, so I'll just try to describe what I think are the relevant qualities of this model.<br /><br />First, it's very well made. Rock solid with no loose parts or rattles at all. The retractable plug snaps firmly into place in both the open and closed position, and it's not difficult to move. The USB ports are sized properly so that cables plug in with ease but are not wobbly or loose inside.<br /><br />The whole unit has an Apple-ish look and feel to it. Well, old school Apple, that is. :) Back when they went with glossy white plastic versus the current aluminum look. I really like it. It reminds me of my older Airport Express unit.<br /><br />Personally, I really like highly compact units like this because I think that they are great for travel. Assuming that wherever you are staying has a power outlet readily available, that is. Luckily, most hotels seems to have one or more power outlets exposed on top of a desk (such as the two on the base of a table lamp at the hotel that I stayed in last week). If you stay somewhere in which the outlets are further out of reach, you'd probably benefit from a different charger that comes with a power cord unless you get an extension cord for this.<br /><br />Two outlets is perfect for me because I tend to take a phone and a tablet with me, and this can charge both with ease. Both ports can handle up to 2.4A, which is beyond what I need on any of my phones or tablets.<br /><br />I have nothing bad at all to say about this charger - I think that it's a great product. If it meets your needs for number of ports, current capability, and outlet accessibility, I recommend it.ets your needs for number of ports, current capability, and outlet accessibility, I recommend it.",06-07-2015,1433672414,223.131.133.117

Along the side you will find a rubber flap, that hides the USB charging port.<br /><br />Features:<br />You can connect to this mini speaker by either Bluetooth or for non-Bluetooth devices, you can plug your device into this speaker with the included cable. Both methods are incredibly easy to do. To connect to this speaker by Bluetooth, all you have to do is simply turn the speaker on by holding the power button down for about 5 seconds until you hear a beeping tone, and then the speaker will automatically go into pairing mode. You will know whether your speaker is in pairing mode, as a Blue LED light will flash on the power button. Then on your compatible Bluetooth devices, search for this speaker in your Bluetooth settings. It should show up as “AS100” in list devices. Once you select this speaker, they should automatically pair together within seconds. When they are paired together, the small LED light on the power button will stop flashing rapidly and will remain solid blue. Once you've connected by Bluetooth, the speaker will automatically remember the last paired device every time you turn the speaker on. If your devices do not have Bluetooth built in, like my old iPod, then you can still use this speaker. Just simply plug in the included Aux-in Cable into your speaker and non-bluetooth device, and then you can start enjoying your music. Also if you have an Micro SD card with music on it, you can plug it into this speaker and listen to music off that as well. The Arespark Bluetooth Speaker also comes with a rechargeable battery built inside, which the manufacturer say can last up to 7 hours before needing to be recharged again. You can also take hands-free calls on this speaker, as there is a built in microphone. To answer and end incoming calls, just press the phone button along the top once.<br /><br />Performance:<br />The Arespark AS100 Mini Bluetooth Speaker came very well packaged, and everything included within the case seems very high quality and well made. Included in the case, you get the Speaker, a USB power Cable, Aux-in Cable and an instruction manual. The instruction manual is very well written, and has very simple text and diagrams explaining how the speaker works. I connected this speaker to my iPhone 5s by Bluetooth, and my iPhone found this speaker straight away and connected to it almost immediately, without any issues. I also connected this speaker to an old iPod by using the Aux-in Cable, and this alsoworked very well. I was very impressed with the sound quality on this speaker, as the sound quality is very clear and well balanced, with a good bass and treble. I was really surprised how loud this little speaker could go, it could easily fill a room full with music. Obviously you will notice the difference compared to an expensive speaker, however for a speaker of this price range, I think its brilliant. All the buttons of this speaker are very responsive. For example, if I press the next button, it goes to the next song almost immediately. The speaker takes around three hours to fully charge, however if you want, you can still use this speaker whilst on charge. Once you have fully charged this speaker, the manufacturer say you should be able to get up to 7 hours of playback (depending on volume levels). This is about right, as I used this speaker for a full day on a medium volume level and got around 7 hours of playback. The Bluetooth range is also very good, as I can move my device up to 10 metres away from my speaker and it remains a stable connection. When you receive an incoming call, the speaker will automatically pause your music whilst you're on the call. I tested the hands-free call feature, although peoples voices sounded very clear through the speaker, other callers did mention that they could hear me but my voice was very quiet (like I was miles away from the speaker) even when I was very close to the speaker, they reported this. This didn't really bother me, as I hardly ever use the hands-free speaker on any speaker.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overall I really like this speaker, its incredibly well made, looks really cool and has a very good sound quality for an excellent price. I would definitely recommend this speaker to anyone, and hopefully my partners nephew will love it too.<br /><br />(I was sent this speaker by the manufacturer in the exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The opinion expressed here is entirely my own view of this speaker)worked very well.
